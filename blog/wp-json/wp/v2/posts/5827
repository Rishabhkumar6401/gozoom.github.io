The journey has been underlined by increasing complexity in both functionalities and data through an effective combination of standardization and application outsourcing.<\/p>\n<p>To reach IT effectiveness\u2014and meet the burgeoning needs of the business, enterprises need to combine intelligence, automation, better use of industry and company knowledge across the application life cycle, and greater use of analytics in application service delivery. The main goal is to outperform and innovate for change to meet evolving IT and business needs, as well as consistent support the automation of repetitive tasks to reduce costs and improve speed and quality.<\/p>\n<p>A typical <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/enterprise-solutions.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">enterprise technology solution<\/a> requires appropriate measures for disaster recovery, as well as ensures the privacy of customers, relevant stakeholders, as well as a real-time reporting feature and monitoring tool.<br \/>\nEnterprise business applications need to combines a host of security features such as SSL certificate, IP restrictions, automatic database backups with complex business logic, and seamless third-party software integrations for high performance.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here are some examples of third-party Integrations<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Realtime messaging system<\/li>\n<li>Diagnostic Tools<\/li>\n<li>Data imports and exports<\/li>\n<li>Directory access service<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Rise_of_PHP_Application_Development_for_Enterprises\"><\/span>Rise of PHP Application Development for Enterprises<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Originally designed for web development, PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor (or simply PHP) is a general-purpose programming language. PHP is a functional and robust language with rising importance in the enterprise world. Ever since PHP 5.0 came out in 2004, enterprises have been experimenting with PHP application development which has been empowering huge platforms like Facebook, Vimeo, and WordPress. It effectively addresses the growing needs of the business as it provides the architecture which supports robust solutions. It is important to partner with a leading <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/php-development.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>PHP Development Company<\/strong><\/a> to leverage all the benefits.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Development Speed and Time to Market<\/li>\n<li>Ability to scale according to business needs<\/li>\n<li>Support<\/li>\n<li>Cost-effective<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Here_are_the_advantages_of_PHP_for_Business_Enterprises\"><\/span>Here are the advantages of PHP for Business Enterprises:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><strong>Diverse Community, Expertise, and Time to Market<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/blog\/the-ultimate-list-of-best-php-development-tools.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PHP application development<\/a> is an open-source and cross-platform language with one of the largest and most dynamic support communities. This large ecosystem of PHP developers makes it easy to hire top developers with a broad knowledge of other common web technologies.<\/p>\n<p>With the rise of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/hire-web-developers.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">full-stack web developers<\/a> majorly using 4 and 5 major programming languages: most common being SQL, JavaScript, and PHP, there is a great deal of interoperability with the same developer building both backend and frontend architectures as well setting production environment and server configurations on AWS or other hosting providers. This level of flexibility means a quick time to market, especially when working on tight deadlines.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Scalability and Performance in PHP Application Development<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>One of the biggest myths surrounding PHP application development is questioning its scalability. This makes the use of PHP for enterprise applications unsuitable and highly questionable for use by the enterprise. However, this approach is highly questionable. The core issues which impact web application development are network traffic or the database connection. PHP offers support for tools such as APC and Redis which cache parts of the code or the database objects, as well as directly store in memory of the server. From there they are instantly loaded on the next call with practically zero latency.<\/p>\n<p>PHP supports major CMS such as WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal. It is notable that WordPress empowers nearly 30 percent of sites and still going strong. Leveraging ready-to-use platforms provide tools for branding, marketing strategy, or eCommerce. There are several plugins or extensions to enhance the platform\u2019s core functionality.<\/p>\n<p>PHP application development supports prominent and mature frameworks with architectural concepts like dependency injection (DI), caching, inversion of control (IoC), and others.<\/p>\n<p>The following aspects of <strong>PHP Web Application Development Services<\/strong> result in a faster development speed and a lower cost for the whole project:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>A strong ecosystem of PHP developers provides robust support for a majority of additional web technologies that might be required for a complete build;<\/li>\n<li>Pre-built modules for direct integration<\/li>\n<li>the processing workflow<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Bugs found can be quickly solved by PHP engineers. Considering the huge support of PHP developers, the chances of a security bug going unnoticed is virtually next to impossible.<\/p>\n<p><strong>PHP and Maintenance<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>PHP provides long-term support when it comes to maintenance. It is needless to say that PHP is serious about robust performance. Considering the new launches and version changes, the PHP development team can expect five years of official support for the version of the language. By the time support for the current version expires, an upgraded version of PHP will be ready in the market providing a similar support lifecycle.<\/p>\n<p><strong>PHP Frameworks for Enterprise App<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>PHP frameworks such as Laravel, Symfony, Yii, Slim, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/cakephp-framework-development.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CakePHP<\/a>, FuelPHP can be selected to build enterprise web-apps. This selection can be on the basis of the level of functionality, features, and high-performance requirements of web apps.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>PHP application development\u200a\u2014\u200awhether for the enterprise or startup\u200a\u2014\u200acan be successful. The strong ecosystem of developers, diversity, proper architecture and a powerful framework all add to the rise of PHP application development for the enterprise.<\/p>\n<p>While enterprises should investigate how they can benefit from PHP application development, the ultimate decision of selection of PHP architecture and technology should be based on business needs and goals.<\/p>\n<div id=\"ez-toc-container\" class=\"ez-toc-v2_0_47_1 ez-toc-wrap-left counter-hierarchy ez-toc-counter ez-toc-transparent ez-toc-container-direction\">\n<div class=\"ez-toc-title-container\">\n<p class=\"ez-toc-title\">Table of Contents<\/p>\n<span class=\"ez-toc-title-toggle\"><\/span><\/div>\n<nav><ul class='ez-toc-list ez-toc-list-level-1 ' ><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/blog\/php-application-development-for-enterprises.html\/#Rise_of_PHP_Application_Development_for_Enterprises\" title=\"Rise of PHP Application Development for Enterprises\">Rise of PHP Application Development for Enterprises<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-2\" href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/blog\/php-application-development-for-enterprises.html\/#Here_are_the_advantages_of_PHP_for_Business_Enterprises\" title=\"Here are the advantages of PHP for Business Enterprises:\">Here are the advantages of PHP for Business Enterprises:<\/a><\/li><\/ul><\/nav><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>From mainframe apps to cloud-based apps, enterprise applications have traveled a long distance.
