The online phenomenon that started back in 2000 is now undergoing an evolution. According to surveys and stats, mobile represents 65 percent of digital media time. On the other hand, desktop\/laptop is becoming a mere secondary touch base point for an increasing number of users.<\/p>\n<p>Online businesses are now going mobile. And why not? It is expected in 2020, mobile apps are projected to generate 188.9 billion U.S. dollars in revenues via app stores and in-app advertising. Today, most mobile users have smart phones and prefer to have information on their handset.<\/p>\n<p>If you thought mobile application is just for multinationals or big companies, think about it again. Mobile applications are providing startups an easy way to connect with users across the globe. Your startup needs a mobile app, you need to get one. After all just having a mobile app is not sufficient, as online activity continues to witness a rapid shift to mobile industry. In simple words, apps are too difficult to ignore.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Enhance your Geographic Reach<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>With billions of users downloading millions of apps, your mobile application helps you overcome geographic barriers. Mobile applications allow startups to reach out to global users and promote their products\/services while improving bottom-line profitability.<\/p>\n<p>Companies that are not offering mobile apps and responsive design sites are quickly fading away and become obsolete in a mobile-driven market. Furthermore, mobile apps offering social media integration can reach the millennial generation who might otherwise not come across your business.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Improve Mobile Customer Service<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Mobile apps can also help startups better serve their customers, respond to customers for great service. Your customers now can connect with your anytime, anywhere with a tap of button allowing them to keep on top of rising customer demands.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Builds Loyalty<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Mobile app helps you digitalize conventional loyalty program, instead of continuing with old point-based systems. This makes it possible for your customers to collect rewards with mobile app, resulting in return customers. Generating loyalty via mobile apps can be achieved through the use of push notifications to consumers informing about sales available to app users. Another way to build loyalty is to create a wish list on items tagged as favorites and providing alerts when such items are available on discounts.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Stand Out From the Competition<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Mobile apps for startups and small businesses are still not a common sight. This helps you take a big leap ahead of your competitors. How does it feel to be the first in your neighborhood to offer a mobile app to your customers to book appointments? You would be surprised that your customers will appreciate your futuristic approach!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Get Contextual<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Mobile experience is all about providing highly contextual and relevant information for a personalized experience. With apps and push notifications, you can provide information about sales, discounts, and special offers anytime, anywhere. Through mobile apps you are getting close to a direct interaction and can easily remind customers about your products and services.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Maximize ROI<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>One of the biggest reasons keeping startups away from mobile application development is the initial costs involved. If you have concerns about costs involved, it is important to understand that not to invest in mobile app might work against your business interests in the long run. Cost of developing app might seem intimidating, but it is nothing compared to the branding value and opportunity to generate additional sales.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Test the Waters<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you still are not sure whether to take a plunge or whether it is worth the cost, you can consider launching an app only with key features and test the pilot version. Based on the feedback of users, you can add more features.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Finally<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Whether you are a salon, coffee shop or a tech startup, it is about time to take your marketing to the next level with a mobile application.
