It allows users to work on creating a virtual world.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Learning_Experience_Platforms\"><\/span><a id=\"learning-experience\"><\/a>Learning Experience Platforms<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>LXPs are single-point-of-access, consumer-grade systems for learning. By delivering on a central platform, LXPs enable businesses to provide an engaging and learning-rich experience and may lessen their reliance on an LMS or talent suite as the learning hub. LXP offers integration with any authoring tools to engage corporate and industrial employees in an interactive environment.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Artificial_Intelligence\"><\/span><a id=\"ai\"><\/a>Artificial Intelligence<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Artificial intelligence can improve and streamline many different processes within education. AI can improve and automate administrative tasks as well as create personalized learning experiences for students.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Mobility\"><\/span><a id=\"mobility\"><\/a>Mobility<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>With the majority of Gen-Z and millennials owning a smartphone these days, the desire to access information anytime, from anywhere is becoming extremely popular among students. The ability for students to access grades, books, and more from anywhere in the world and take classes without physically being in the classroom is taking learning to a new level.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"IoT\"><\/span><a id=\"iot\"><\/a>IoT<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>But <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">eLearning<\/span>, if put to good, can be the game-changer in doing away with this challenge.

Animation is among the top new trends and innovations in the education industry. Animation is being used by educational institutions to make the learning process more interactive and interesting for the students. Animation paves the path for good storytelling and helps in the generation of relevant content that simulates real scenarios.<\/p>\n<p>Animation helps to increase the engagement of students in the learning process and helps them to retain knowledge. The use of animation is also expanding towards training the learning and development department instead of only having learning applications. Animation is much more beneficial compared to traditional training methods. It helps to visualize real-life working conditions.<\/p>\n<p>In the conventional methods, trainees often drown in the text-based training materials that they receive. Animation helps to incorporate audio, visuals. Motion and other aids make it easier for trainees to understand the training and remember what they learn. Moreover, as the brains of humans react strongest to visual stimuli, animation helps both students and employees to remember study\/training materials more effectively.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Blockchain_Technology\"><\/span><a id=\"blockchain\"><\/a>Blockchain Technology<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>While talking about the future trends in education 2022, blockchain technology could not be left behind. This is more targeted towards the employees that work in educational institutions. It could be described as a ledger that removes intermediaries in case of transactions. It allows individuals to make digital transactions. While this technology was previously only used in the Bitcoin industry, it is becoming more popular in the mainstream industries.<\/p>\n<p>The most important utilization of blockchain technology could be attributed to the large data storage features. It would help educational institutions to keep adding training materials for their staff without the fear of running out of storage space. It would also enable the employers to keep a better track of the certifications and qualifications of their employees. Blockchains are multilingual and as a result, empower employers to not miss out on document translation.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Big_Data\"><\/span><a id=\"bigdata\"><\/a>Big Data<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Big Data is being considered as the most impactful tool that is present today. Embracing technology trends in education would lead to the incorporation of big data in the educational field. While big data was previously mainly used in the retail business, it has found its application in several other industries as well. In simple terms, Big Data enables an organization to collect, store and analyze large volumes of data. Some of the tech giants that are using big data are Google, Amazon, Netflix, and American Express.<\/p>\n<p>In the educational field, big data could find its utilization in increasing the productivity of newly hired employees. Consistent data paired with appropriate data mining tools would help educational institutions in identifying the patterns and enable them to determine the most helpful training programs. This could be determined for every job category that exists in the organization.<\/p>\n<p>It also helps to provide new scope for the HR department of an institution. It helps them to customize training programs for both their teaching and non-teaching employees. All these benefits have the potential to make big data the new big thing in the education industry in 2022.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"The_Future_Ahead\"><\/span>The Future Ahead<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The eLearning market is on the move, and trends in the education industry are awaiting those who wish to explore. With population explosion, poverty, joblessness, lack of funds and infrastructural facilities engulfing most nations; the education industry fueled by a breakthrough <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">eLearning<\/span> solution can be the game-changer.<\/p>\n<p>eLearning supports effective and enhanced utilization of the institutional resources while reaching the maximum number of users with the same faculty strength (as in a virtual classroom). It also allows you to reach out to innumerable users through the medium of an educational gaming application. Mobile applications for toddlers and preschoolers such as learning alphabets, numeric, shapes, colors, etc. through games and puzzles, memory games, etc. \u2013 designed with attractive graphics, animations, and audio are always in high demand at the App Stores.<\/p>\n<div id=\"ez-toc-container\" class=\"ez-toc-v2_0_47_1 ez-toc-wrap-left counter-hierarchy ez-toc-counter ez-toc-transparent
