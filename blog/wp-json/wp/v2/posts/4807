For the interaction of the users with online business companies scattered over the net, client server based applications are playing a significant role. Millions of the people everyday interacts by the mode of these active websites for their respective interests.<\/p>\n<p>To know about the functioning of these websites over the net one should understand the client server model first, without the knowledge of client server model; non technical person cannot understand the importance of the client server applications.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/covid-19-business-continuity-plans.html?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_campaign=covid-10&amp;utm_term=Business%20Continuity%20Plans\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter pdimgauto size-full wp-image-7735\" src=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/business-continuity-plans-during-covid-19.jpg\" alt=\"Business Continuity Plans during Covid-19\" width=\"728\" height=\"90\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/business-continuity-plans-during-covid-19.jpg 728w, https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/business-continuity-plans-during-covid-19-300x37.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>In the context of web, client server model is divided into web client and web server. In this model client is any web browser through which any information or query can be passed for the web server and server is supposed to answer that query.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, here client is a web browser and server is web server on World Wide Web, as soon as any user of the internet uses any browser for access of web page, then browser requests web page from server to display for the internet user. After receiving the request from web client, server use to send the webpage to browser for display to user.<\/p>\n<p>Rapid competition in the online business is attracting the big as well as small &amp; medium online business companies to develop the applications by using client server architecture which provides quality communication environment between client and server.<\/p>\n<p>There are various characteristics of client-server architecture which makes the web communication easy via applications such as scalability which allows to scale clients and servers horizontally or vertically, communication through APIs (application program interfaces) &amp; RPCs (Remote procedure call) and environment is heterogeneous and multivendor, client \u2013 server architecture provides combination of client which interacts with user &amp; server that interacts with the shared resource, etc.<\/p>\n<p>In the present scenario of online business, growing demands of the online users for the business activities over the net requires, for the quick responses and quality services, which cannot be fulfilled by using the old concepts, methods and architectures of developing web applications.<\/p>\n<p>Growing masses of Hi-Tech customers in the online business environment demand, for more interactive and attractive applications, error- free solutions. For the development of eCommerce websites and applications, client server architecture is used by the contemporary application developers.<\/p>\n<p>For the quality client server application development and professional assistance, business companies from all over the world prefers to hire reputed service providers, for the high level of business presentation on web and customer satisfaction.<\/p>\n<p>Over the time, the client\/server model has become one of the central ideas of network computing. A large number of business applications that are written today utilize the client\/server model including the Internet&#8217;s main program, TCP\/IP.<\/p>\n<p>In the field of marketing, this term has been used to differentiate distributed computing by means of smaller dispersed computers from the &#8220;monolithic&#8221; centralized computing of mainframe computers. With time, as systems evolved, the distinction largely dissipated as mainframes and their applications also eventually turned to the client\/server model and became a major part of network computing.<\/p>\n<p>Below are some of the features of client\/server architecture:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"margin-left: 30px;\">\n<li>Service<\/li>\n<li>Shared resources<\/li>\n<li>Functional modules<\/li>\n<li>Asymmetrical Protocols<\/li>\n<li>Transparency of location<\/li>\n<li>Mix-and-Match<\/li>\n<li>Message based exchanges<\/li>\n<li>Encapsulation of Services<\/li>\n<li>Scalability<\/li>\n<li>Integrity<\/li>\n<li>Robustness<\/li>\n<li>Authentication<\/li>\n<li>Secrecy<\/li>\n<li>Availability<\/li>\n<li>Timeliness<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Service:<\/strong> Client\/Server can be established as a relationship between different processes that run on separate machines. On one end the server process is a provider of service and on the other end the client is a consumer of services.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Shared resources:<\/strong> A server has the ability to service multiple clients at simultaneously and regulate their overall access to shared resources.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Functional modules:<\/strong> The client\/server also acts as a functional module that has well-defined interfaces embedded in it. Most of the functions which are performed by a client and a server can be implemented by a set of software modules, hardware components, or both. They can also run on dedicated machines, if needed.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Asymmetrical Protocols:<\/strong> Between clients and servers, there exists a m:1 relationship. Clients are the one who initiate the dialog by requesting a service. Servers on the other end passively await requests from the clients.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Transparency of location:<\/strong> The server is a process that houses on the same machine as the client or on an entirely different machine across a network. Client\/server software creates a veil across the location of the server from the clients by redirecting the service calls when needed. A program can either be a client, a server or both.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Mix-and-Match:<\/strong> A stable client\/server software works independent of hardware or OS software platforms, enabling us to mix-and-match client and server program.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Message based exchanges:<\/strong> Client\/server is a system that is loosely coupled and interacting through a message-passing mechanism. The message acts as the delivery mechanism for the service requests and replies.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Encapsulation of Services:<\/strong> The server can be termed as a \u201cSpecialist\u201d. In the first step, message tells a server what service is requested, in the next step the server than determines how to get the job done. One can upgrade the server without affecting the clients as long as the published message interface is not deterred.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Scalability:<\/strong> You can scale the client\/server horizontally or vertically. Horizontal scaling will add or remove client workstation with only a slight performance impact. Vertical scaling will migrate it to a larger and faster server machine or multi-server.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Integrity:<\/strong> In the client\/server architecture, the server code and data is centrally maintained resulting in cheaper utilization maintenance and the guarding of shared data integrity. Simultaneously, the clients remain personal and independent.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Robustness:<\/strong> The server should not expect client code to be error free.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Authentication:<\/strong> More often than usual, a few clients should be permitted to use a particular service.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Secrecy:<\/strong> The data has to be encrypted in order to keep it private when it is sent over public networks.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Availability:<\/strong> Denial of service (DoS) attacks are particularly problematic. They can involve very large numbers of requests coming from a number of coordinated sites. The server is expected to identify such attacks and ignore the messages involved in the attack.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Timeliness:<\/strong> Servers are expected to respond within tight time deadlines in order to ensure QoS. This can sometimes be problematic, at times where the load on the server can be very variable.<\/p>\n<h4 style=\"font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 42px; color: #0a57f4;\">Conclusion<\/h4>\n<p>Client\/server systems have become the computing and application architecture for business organizations across the globe. Speaking in technical terms, a client\/server system puts application processing close to the user; helping improve the performance.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Image Source: Technology vector created by vectorpouch &#8211; www.freepik.com Growing impact of Client Server Model for the enhancement of online business have created potential demand of the client server based applications.
