This saves time of waiting in long queue and walk out of the store with the purchased products.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Physical stores feel much more alive and interactive when accompanied with Augmented Reality technology.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Augmented_Reality_for_Ecommerce\"><\/span>Augmented Reality for Ecommerce<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Apart from implementing <strong>Augmented Reality in retail outlets<\/strong>, this technology is showing wonders in ecommerce stores too.
