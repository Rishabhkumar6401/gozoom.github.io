There are millions of applications already developed using .NET in different domains. Build native applications for Windows, iOS, and Android simply by reusing your C# skills. You can even hire a C# programmer to fulfill your needs.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a programmer, coding in a language which is steady and continually advancing is significant. It does not just make everyday life simpler and steadily enjoyable, but it also racks up productivity and, in some cases, prevents undesired bugs and errors.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"color: #000; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 40px;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Model_Binding\"><\/span>Model Binding<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Are you aware of the fact that because of model binding, Razor pages and controllers work with data coming from HTTP requests? With respect to this, you can easily and seamlessly extract useful information while there is absolutely no need for coding again.<\/p>\n<p>The model binding system recovers information from different sources, for example, from fields, routes, and inquiry strings. Also, this technique provides information to razor pages and controllers in public properties and parameters.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"color: #000; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 40px;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Asynchronous_Programming_Patterns\"><\/span>Asynchronous Programming Patterns<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>While using ASP.NET you get outstanding support for using asynchronous programming patterns. Async is currently executed in all classes of the .NET Framework and most of the libraries.<\/p>\n<p>One of the core reasons ASP.NET Core is quicker is its extensive utilization of asynchronous patterns in the new Kestrel and MVC frameworks.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"color: #000; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 40px;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Easy_to_maintain\"><\/span>Easy to maintain<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>You don\u2019t have to brainstorm much to understand this aspect. The reason behind this is simple and reasonable. The logic is that it is effortless and easy to maintain less code than to maintain complex ones.<\/p>\n<p>For someone who has just started out as a programmer, this may not be simple to know this pattern, however for an accomplished engineer, he surely realizes how to optimize the whole code in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/asp-net-core-development.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ASP.NET Core<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>It becomes imperative to keep yourself updated with all the most recent improvements to the programming language. Continuously examine and learn about the most recent changes in language.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"color: #000; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 40px;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Optimize_Data_Access\"><\/span>Optimize Data Access<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Did you know that access to data is one of the slowest activities in an application? It is tiresome and exhausting for many programmers sometimes.<\/p>\n<p>One needs to call all data to get to APIs asynchronously. It is important that you decrease roundtrips in the database and recover just the information that is required. Try to refrain from using projection inquiries on collections. In a case where you are utilizing Entity Framework Core for access to data, make sure you follow the prescribed rules and practices in Entity Framework Core.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, if you are reading information\/data that would not be changed by the application, you should definitely take the benefit of the no-tracking queries.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Features_of_ASPNet\"><\/span>Features of ASP.Net<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Cross-platform_Support\"><\/span>Cross-platform Support<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>With the advancement of technology, now developers can enjoy cross-platform features with ASP.Net and deploy the solutions in Windows, Linus, and Mac OS. The ASP.Net developers now can take advantage of Docker(PaaS Container Platform), Kubernetes(Container orchestration system), and Microsoft\u2019s Azure(Cloud computing service).<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Better_Performance\"><\/span>Better Performance<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Performance is the key factor while developing a project. With the latest update of the ASP. Net framework, developers now enjoy better performance and high speed while developing the web app. An ASP.Net expert can definitely notice the change in the superior performance of the application developed in ASP. Net technology as compared to other options. Different features like networking, concurrency, compression, and serialization compute with higher speed in the latest iteration.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, the HTTP request size is also reduced to 2Kb which further enhances the performance.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Self-hosted_Applications\"><\/span>Self-hosted Applications<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>ASP.net developers can now develop self-hosted applications using the technology without depending on Internet Information Service(IIS). These applications are self-hosted. When it comes to Linux systems, the web applications are hosted on Nginx. IIS and Nginx support reverse proxies for these applications.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Support_of_SignalR_Java_Client\"><\/span>Support of SignalR Java Client<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Developed especially for the .Net Framework, The SignalR Java Client library allows the server code to send asynchronous notifications to the applications that are deployed on the client side. SignalR Java client consists of components of Javascript on both client and server sides. Developers can use this client to add functionalities to the application in real-time. Besides this, the client selects the best option for transportation according to the availability on the server and client-side.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Introduction_to_Razor_Pages\"><\/span>Introduction to Razor Pages<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Another latest feature of ASP.Net is the introduction of razor pages. The pages simplify the coding scenario and thus increase productivity. With these pages, developers can not implement the self-sufficient views of the controllers which allows them to create development-related scenarios. The ease of developing these scenarios allows developers to enjoy a bird-eye view of the whole architecture of the application.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Development_Models_in_ASPNET\"><\/span>Development Models in ASP.NET<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Web<\/strong>: Build web applications and services for different platforms such as Windows, Linux, macOS, and Docker.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Mobile:<\/strong> Single codebase to build native mobile apps for iOS, Android, and Windows.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Desktop:<\/strong> Create beautiful and persuasive desktop apps for Windows and macOS.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Microservices:<\/strong> Independently deployable microservices that run on Docker containers.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Gaming:<\/strong> Develop highly immersive and popular 2D and 3D games for the most popular desktops, phones, and consoles.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Machine Learning: <\/strong>Add different vision algorithms, speech processing, predictive models, and more to your apps.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Cloud: <\/strong>Consume existing cloud services or create and deploy your own app.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Internet of Things:<\/strong> Make IoT apps, with native support for the Raspberry Pi and other single-board computers.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_to_Hire_a_NET_Developer_Step_By_Step_Guide\"><\/span>How to Hire a .NET Developer?

So, before you start searching for an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/asp-net-development.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ASP.NET development company<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/hire-asp-net-developers.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hiring top .NET developers<\/a>, write out exactly what it is that you want.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Are there certain features that are absolutely necessary?<\/li>\n<li>What style of interface do you prefer?<\/li>\n<li>How much will it cost?<\/li>\n<li>Write down whatever comes to mind.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The more clear and concise your request, the better\u2014especially because different agencies and development teams define good work differently.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Check_Credentials\"><\/span>Check Credentials<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Credentials aren\u2019t everything, but they are a very good starting point to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/hire-asp-net-developers.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hire .NET developers<\/a>. Have a clear idea of what skills you need and be able to check them off when you find a qualified candidate.<\/p>\n<p>If possible, set up interviews with different companies that use candidates with those skillsets; if an interview doesn\u2019t feel right, don\u2019t hire them. The company culture is just as important as their coding knowledge\u2014and you should do everything in your power to make sure both are in line with what makes your business tick.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Get_to_Know_Them_Personally\"><\/span>Get to Know Them Personally<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>In order to work well together, you\u2019ll need a rapport with your offshore development team and will have to be able to connect on a personal level. Make sure they understand your company goals and can give thoughtful advice when you are stuck.<\/p>\n<p>Not only will this relationship help guide your project through faster, but it\u2019ll also make for happy employees and lower turnover. Keep in mind that once you hire them, they\u2019re an extension of your company.<\/p>\n<p>Having rapport means they feel like an important part of your business; if not, they might not feel as passionate about their work or are willing to take extra time when needed.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Work_Experience_Matters\"><\/span>Work Experience Matters<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Some companies base their hiring decisions solely on a candidate\u2019s past work experience, which can be problematic if you\u2019re looking for an up-and-coming developer who lacks work experience.<\/p>\n<p>If a candidate has a strong portfolio and background, but limited work experience, look for other ways to evaluate his or her skills and potential as part of your offshore development team.<\/p>\n<p>For example, consider asking candidates to create a web application from scratch based on very little information. This task forces them to rely on their own ability rather than what they did at their last job.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Ask candidates to complete real programming tasks:<\/strong> It\u2019s one thing to have theoretical knowledge of programming languages and software development methodologies; it\u2019s another thing entirely to have practical knowledge.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Interview in person:<\/strong> Many startups conduct interviews over Skype or Google Hangouts, even though face time is often more effective in determining whether someone will fit into your culture.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Ask_for_References\"><\/span>Ask for References<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>How do you know whether or not someone is going to be a good fit for your company? Asking for recommendations from previous employers can help you narrow down your list of potential hires, but references should only tell you so much.<\/p>\n<p>At some point in time, you\u2019ll want to talk with their former managers and coworkers directly\u2014it\u2019s an excellent way to get additional information about their skills and experience as well as what they\u2019re like personally.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do be careful, though:<\/strong> Having one bad reference isn\u2019t enough reason to avoid someone entirely. Just be sure not to hire anyone with more than two negative reviews on either end of that spectrum.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Reach_Out_Without_Spamming\"><\/span>Reach Out Without Spamming<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>When hiring a development team for your business, you need to look at more than just their specific development skills. You also need to make sure they are going to mesh well with your overall strategy.<\/p>\n<p>It is important that you choose an ASP.NET web development company with a pool of talented .NET developers capable of fitting into your larger vision. Your offshore development team will work as part of your team rather than against it.<\/p>\n<p>Look for companies offering that aligns well with what you\u2019re trying to accomplish and then take a closer look at their technical expertise.<\/p>\n<p>If they are missing critical skills, don\u2019t hesitate to ask about it\u2014the right developer might be able to refer someone else or offer assistance in completing an important project.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Choose_Wisely\"><\/span>Choose Wisely<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Not all development companies are created equal. As in any business, you want to make sure that your developer has the experience and is up-to-date on industry trends.<\/p>\n<p>You can test their expertise by asking them questions about recent developments in their field and how they would address them for your project. This is also a good time to ask about certifications and company policies, like hours of operation or turnaround times.<\/p>\n<p><strong>And don\u2019t forget:<\/strong> Check reviews before you commit! Ask for recommendations. Then read up on those companies\u2014both good and bad\u2014before you decide which one&#8217;s right for you.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Technical_Screening_of_Professional_NET_Developer_Skills_During_a_PhoneVideo_Interview\"><\/span>Technical Screening of Professional .NET Developer Skills During a Phone\/Video Interview.<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>It is important to screen ASP.NET developers and decipher conclusions about developer skillsets. In order to <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/hire-asp-net-developers.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hire dedicated remote ASP.Net developers<\/a><\/strong>, understand the candidate\u2019s background and technical expertise by asking specific questions about the skills that you want to verify. Ask questions relating to ASP.NET MVC (Model View Controller) and understand the skill set of developers to make robust and secure web applications. The questions need to vary based on the position you are recruiting for and the specific skills you want to verify.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Online_Coding_Test\"><\/span>Online Coding Test<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Online coding tests can be a great way to understand the overall background of ASP.NET developers. In fact, performance in online coding tests can help evaluate candidates in a better way compared to mere resume screening or interviews.<\/p>\n<p>Depending on your company\u2019s approach, coding tests be used as the primary method of screening .NET developer skills or an additional one, next to resume analysis and a phone interview. Keep analyzing to identify programming tests to streamline your technical screening process and what should be included in order to provide accurate information.<\/p>\n<p>Several companies are turning to coding tests as the primary method for screening as they give IT recruiters a couple of crucial benefits:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Online tests should verify not only .NET developer skills, but also knowledge of frameworks and libraries.<\/li>\n<li>.NET coding tests should contain programming tasks that match the responsibilities the candidates will have if they get the job.<\/li>\n<li>Considering preparing .NET programming tasks based on the company\u2019s code. This is one of the most prominent ways to imitate the challenges the candidate will have once they get the job.<\/li>\n<li>Programming task to review coding challenges.<\/li>\n<li>.NET developer skills give information about the experience of the candidate, approach to code quality, and how efficiently they perform debugging and find traps.<\/li>\n<li>Coding tests show a willingness to participate in the recruitment process with a positive impact on a candidate\u2019s engagement.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Conclusion\"><\/span>Conclusion<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Hiring is hard enough. There are so many factors that can determine whether you end up with a good hire or a bad one\u2014from past experience to education. Finding a perfect fit can be challenging, especially if you\u2019re not sure where to look for candidates.<\/p>\n<p>Look for people who are dedicated and educated in their field, as well as people who work within your budget. The wrong developer will only cost you more time and money in the long run!<\/p>\n<div id=\"ez-toc-container\" class=\"ez-toc-v2_0_47_1 ez-toc-wrap-left counter-hierarchy ez-toc-counter
