There is a new way to interact with computing, the web, and connected infrastructure. In the inception stage, it is all about discovering the idea and nurturing and refining the idea. But, it is important to understand that not all ideas can be transformed into mobile applications. Before you take a plunge into the app development process, it is important to introspect and ask few fundamental questions.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Competitive Edge\u2013<\/strong> Are there similar competitor apps out there? If so, how is your mobile application a cut above the others?<\/li>\n<li><strong>Value to Users \u2013<\/strong> What value does your app offer to users?<\/li>\n<li><strong>Form\/Mobility \u2013<\/strong> How this app works in different mobile forms leveraging technologies such as location awareness and more.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Equally important is to dive into research \u2014into your own business and target audience, as well as that of your competitors.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What are the goals of your mobile apps?<\/li>\n<li>Who is your target audience?<\/li>\n<li>Are you targeting any particular age group or region?<\/li>\n<li>How will your mobile app add value to the lives of its users<\/li>\n<li>How does your audience use your app?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There are also some questions typically associated with technology, frameworks, and platforms that you will target.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Are you planning to launch iOS or Android or go cross-platform?<\/li>\n<li>Which mobile app OS, language and framework should you use?<\/li>\n<li>What is your overall app development budget?<\/li>\n<li>When do you plan to launch your app?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It is during this stage that you align your team, whether it is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/hire-mobile-app-developers.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">expert mobile app developers<\/a> or app development team to work across the entire lifecycle, as well as your sales, marketing team. A team structure will help you to conduct a smooth development process.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Wireframes_and_Storyboards\"><\/span>Wireframes and Storyboards<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Now with all research and analysis in place, it is time to give your application idea a structure or visual form with wireframes &amp; storyboarding. This stage will allow you to give an idea of what features to include and what to give a miss. Remember, wireframing will save you costly mistakes in the future.<\/p>\n<p>You should also create a roadmap to establish the connections and context between each screen and the way users will navigate through the app. Keep these pointers in mind as you sketch:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Look for opportunities to incorporate your brand.<\/li>\n<li>Focus on the user experience.<\/li>\n<li>Consider the differences in the way people use a mobile app versus a mobile website.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>While there are many tools for online wireframing, you need to focus all your energy on features to include launching a functional app. Here, you will get a clear picture of the scope of work, as well as processes that will be performed in-house and tasks which can be outsourced to a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/mobile-app-development.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mobile app development<\/a> company.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"UXUI_Design\"><\/span>UX\/UI Design<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>UI\/UX plays an important role in implementing the features and functionality of the app. One of the most defining factors in the success of your application is creating an engaging user experience specific to the platform. It\u2019s crucial to take into account all interface guidelines for the various platforms that the app will target.<\/p>\n<p>The app should give users a specific feel for different platforms. The design guidelines for each platform are very detailed and outlined specifically. Each OS and device has a specific way of switching within applications.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Apple &#8211; Human Interface Guidelines<\/li>\n<li>Android \u2013 Design Guidelines<\/li>\n<li>UWP \u2013 UWP Design basics<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Furthermore, devices such as iPad and tablets also influence UX decisions with considerably more space to display more information. Different forms of devices, dimensions, and conflicting operating systems often play a critical role in defining the way information is shown.<\/p>\n<p>It is time to create the UI design based on UX, where elements such as colors, typography, animations graphics are introduced and finalized. Don\u2019t rush through this stage. Most successful apps have the best brand recall with their unique design language for different platforms.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"What_is_the_Mobile_App_Development_Stages\"><\/span>What is the Mobile App Development Stages<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The development phase kick starts very early. A prototype paves the way for functionality validation, assumptions, and giving a preview of the scope of the work. Mobile app development encompasses several steps and processes such as storage solutions, databases, APIs, and servers.<\/p>\n<p><strong>This phase consists of two main parts:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Front-end development \u2013 Client-side development, creating a front layer of presentation of the software for users to interact with.<\/li>\n<li>Back-end development \u2013 Server\/database part of development, combining front-end of the mobile app with the data access part.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you have partnered with a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/mobile-app-development.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mobile app development company<\/a>, establish a timeline for deliverables before the project starts. Always glean through the app store guidelines so your app isn\u2019t rejected during the review process.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"QA_Testing_Stabilization\"><\/span>QA, Testing &amp; Stabilization<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Now that you have done the majority of hard work and have the app ready, it is still not over. You have reached a crucial stage of the app development lifecycle- QA &amp; testing.<\/p>\n<p>Rigorously and meticulously test your application on different devices and different scenarios to iron out any technical bugs.<\/p>\n<p>Stabilization is the process of working out the bugs in your app and is most effective when it starts early within the development process to avoid costly mistakes. Typically, here is the pattern involved: Prototype, Alpha, Beta, and Release.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Launch_Distribution\"><\/span>Launch &amp; Distribution<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Once the application has been stabilized, it\u2019s time for launch &amp; distribution on Apple\u2019s AppStore and Google PlayStore.<\/p>\n<p>We hope this blog helps you with the basic outline of the mobile app development process to build winning apps.<\/p>\n<div id=\"ez-toc-container\" class=\"ez-toc-v2_0_47_1 ez-toc-wrap-left counter-hierarchy ez-toc-counter ez-toc-transparent ez-toc-container-direction\">\n<div class=\"ez-toc-title-container\">\n<p class=\"ez-toc-title\">Table of Contents<\/p>\n<span class=\"ez-toc-title-toggle\"><\/span><\/div>\n<nav><ul class='ez-toc-list ez-toc-list-level-1 ' ><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/blog\/mobile-app-development-process-steps.html\/#Here_is_a_quick_view_of_what_the_mobile_app_development_process_looks_like_and_the_specialists_involved_at_different_stages\" title=\"Here is a quick view of what the mobile app development process looks like and the specialists involved at different stages.\">Here is a quick view of what the mobile app development process looks like and the specialists involved at different stages.<\/a><ul class='ez-toc-list-level-3'><li class='ez-toc-heading-level-3'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-2\" href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/blog\/mobile-app-development-process-steps.html\/#Planning_Stage\" title=\"Planning Stage\">Planning Stage<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-3'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-3\" href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/blog\/mobile-app-development-process-steps.html\/#Prototyping\" title=\"Prototyping\">Prototyping<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-3'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-4\" href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/blog\/mobile-app-development-process-steps.html\/#Development\" title=\"Development\">Development<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-3'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-5\" href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/blog\/mobile-app-development-process-steps.html\/#Quality_Assurance\" title=\"Quality Assurance\">Quality Assurance<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-3'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-6\" href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/blog\/mobile-app-development-process-steps.html\/#Publishing_Maintenance\" title=\"Publishing &amp; Maintenance\">Publishing &amp; Maintenance<\/a><\/li><\/ul><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-7\" href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/blog\/mobile-app-development-process-steps.html\/#Inception_Research_Technical_Stack\" title=\"Inception, Research &amp; Technical Stack\">Inception, Research &amp; Technical Stack<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-8\" href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/blog\/mobile-app-development-process-steps.html\/#Wireframes_and_Storyboards\" title=\"Wireframes and Storyboards\">Wireframes and Storyboards<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-9\" href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/blog\/mobile-app-development-process-steps.html\/#UXUI_Design\" title=\"UX\/UI Design\">UX\/UI Design<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-10\" href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/blog\/mobile-app-development-process-steps.html\/#What_is_the_Mobile_App_Development_Stages\" title=\"What is the Mobile App Development Stages\">What is the Mobile App Development Stages<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-11\" href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/blog\/mobile-app-development-process-steps.html\/#QA_Testing_Stabilization\" title=\"QA, Testing &amp; Stabilization\">QA, Testing &amp; Stabilization<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-12\" href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/blog\/mobile-app-development-process-steps.html\/#Launch_Distribution\" title=\"Launch &amp; Distribution\">Launch &amp; Distribution<\/a><\/li><\/ul><\/nav><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The mobile app development process is a daunting task.
