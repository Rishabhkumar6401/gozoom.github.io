The overall success of your eCommerce business depends on the number of customers buying this stuff. And not just once, but over and over again.<\/p>\n<p>However, there lies one problem. The way you manage your stuff or to be precise, the inventory \u2013 could potentially interfere with how much money your business makes. In a worst case scenario, it might result in you losing money.<\/p>\n<p>As an online retailer, it should be your goal to remain profitable while keeping your customers happy through proper inventory management. And that is exactly why you are reading this.<\/p>\n<p>Let us go over some amazing techniques to help you keep your inventory in order and dodge some of the most common merchandise mishaps that happen with online sellers.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Importance_of_Inventory_Management\"><\/span>Importance of Inventory Management<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>So let\u2019s accept the fact that holding inventory takes money. If as an online retailer, you have items in stock and they aren\u2019t sold, profits can be narrow. You end up with products sitting on your shelves collecting dust in a warehouse.<\/p>\n<p>On the contrary, if you do not have products in stock at all, it may end up in you struggling to get merchandise from suppliers in time. And this could be the moment of confrontation which many retailers fondly like to avoid: having to place the dreaded \u201cout of stock\u201d label on your product pages. Not being able to deliver on demand can result in loss of sales, canceled orders, and unhappy customers.<\/p>\n<p>If you look around, you will find innumerous horror stories from even the biggest corporations losing money due to poor inventory management; be it the example of how Barbie SUVs snarled traffic and put <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-target-canada-exclusive-idUSBREA4K03X20140521\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">Target in a supply chain gridlock<\/a> or a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.in\/retail\/nike-is-facing-unprecedented-headwinds\/articleshow\/53053406.cms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">$100 million loss for Nike.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Avoid such expensive mistakes and get proactive with your inventory management; be prepared for any situation, come what may.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Challenges_Faced_by_Online_Retailers_to_have_Proper_Inventory_Management\"><\/span>Challenges Faced by Online Retailers to have Proper Inventory Management<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Undoubtedly, the basis of your business should be to quickly get your products to customers and turn a profit. Meaning, your products need to be ready-to-go as soon as the order comes in. Inventory management doesn\u2019t come naturally to many business owners and it is a fact. There are times when one may feel like they are spending countless hours checking inventory and making sure the numbers add up. For someone who is not a fan of numbers, this may seem like a tedious, confusing effort.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Incorrect Numbers:-<\/strong> Has it even happened to you where you tried fulfilling orders thinking you have three products in stock when you had only one? Incorrect and poor track of inventory can force you to have to cancel orders, leading to your business having a poor reputation among unhappy customers. It can also make you question your inventory numbers across the board, leading to major accounting issues.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Overstocking and Under-stocking:-<\/strong> It is implied that you neither want overstocked inventory nor do you want understocked inventory. Overstocking and understocking alike can both cause unforeseen and unpleasant financial issues for your business.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Best_Tips_and_Techniques_to_Smartly_Manage_Your_Inventory\"><\/span>Best Tips and Techniques to Smartly Manage Your Inventory<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Take complete control of your online store and become the smart business owner with these smart tips to help you save money.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"color: #000; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 40px;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"1_Set_a_minimum_threshold_for_stock_levels\"><\/span>1. Set a minimum threshold for stock levels<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>This is also known as your \u201cpar levels\u201d. Minimum Stock Level or MSL of your online store is the minimum amount of product you should have on hand at all times. This number helps you define that when your inventory falls below this number, it\u2019s time to order more.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"color: #000; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 40px;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"2_Prioritize_your_products_with_ABC_Analysis\"><\/span>2.

Assuming that you do not have this history to look back on, things might be a tad bit difficult but certainly not impossible.<\/p>\n<p>To do the least, try to look at data for the past year to establish a \u201cbase demand\u201d level for each season. You can then use this information to forecast what future demand will be like<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"color: #000; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 40px;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"4_Keep_your_inventory_management_centralized\"><\/span>4.
