Why is big data the talk of the town? Why do companies invest heavily in prescriptive and predictive analytics?<\/p>\n<p>Before we answer all these questions, let us start from the basics. What led to the emergence of Big Data?<\/p>\n<p>The increasing amounts of data throughout industries spread all over the globe have led to its emergence. It is simply a cumulation of immeasurable size of data which has a scale that is too varied too large to comprehend. And unconventional technologies cannot deal with this data efficiently.<\/p>\n<p>In the year 2000, <a href=\"https:\/\/uk.sagepub.com\/sites\/default\/files\/upm-binaries\/63924_Kitchin_Ch4.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">800,000 petabytes of data were stored in the world<\/a> and this number is expected to reach 35 zettabytes by 2020. This data consists a diverse range of data types such as texts, weblogs, GPS locations, sensor information, graphs, videos, audio and everything online.<\/p>\n<p>Talking about Prescriptive analytics,it can be defined as something that involves bringing out optimal planning decisions given the predicted future and addressing questions such as \u201cwhat shall be done in this case?\u201d and \u201cwhy shall it be done?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In industries like logistics, predictive analysis or analytics is done with respect to operational performance metrics such as delivery service levels and impact analysis of external factors such as exchange rates, fuel prices, and carrier rates.<\/p>\n<p>Other practical applications include collaborative Sales and Operations Planning (S&amp;OP) by connecting statistical forecasting methods for demand planning. There are techniques such as analytic hierarchy process and game theory that have been described to lie within the \u2018Source\u2019 classification.<\/p>\n<p>The development of big data analytics and especially prescriptive analytics across industries has time-warped into the future already. Here are some prime examples of how prescriptive analytics is changing the face of various industries across the globe.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Prescriptive_Analytics_in_Banking\"><\/span>Prescriptive Analytics in Banking<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>In a recent Crowe Horwath LLP webinar involving bank executives from a broad array of organizations, most of the participants 63 percent of them said that they were interested in moving beyond descriptive and diagnostic data studies.
