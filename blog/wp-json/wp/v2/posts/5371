This is the only way wearables will emerge as a true winner in the workplace. As technology evolves wearables will become an interesting communication tool.<\/p>\n<p>Wearable devices have the potential to impact each and every industry and the technology has been successfully implemented across retail, real estate, construction, and logistics. Can this technology improve work landscape or streamline processes?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Retail Industry<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Wearable adoption is opening up innovative ways for retailers to reach out to customer and improve conversion ratio. Wearable technology can transform retail operations by providing faster checkout and payment processes; quicker access to promotional offers; and more real-time input into purchasing decision.<br \/>\nSmartwatches can serve as a natural extension of the online or mobile brand experience and serve as an integrated touchpoint to create an omnichannel experience for customers.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Healthcare<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Consumers still have not opened to the idea of healthcare wearables other than trackers for fitness. The rising popularity of Fitbit indicates that users have embraced wearables that help keep track of health and fitness goals.<br \/>\nThe multitude of smartwatches and health trackers help healthcare practitioners monitor personal health data and connect with patients in astonishing new ways. As users (patients) begin to wear monitoring devices, health care practitioners can access critical data via mobile applications during different stages of hospitalization. With greater connectivity and access to actionable health insights, wearable technology will help enrich and improve quality of lives.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Health Insurance Industry<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Wearables could transform the health insurance industry. Bio-sensor, a wearable\/implanted device can transmit data about biological processes which will introduce several ways to diagnose and treat health conditions. This implanted device can provide relatively accurate information about an individual\u2019s physical condition, leading to precise assessment of risk and accurate medical diagnosis.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Advertising<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Growth of wearables provide the opportunity for advertisers to reach out to their customers in a really big way. After all, there is one more screen\/device to target and deliver marketing campaigns right from smartwatches to headgear.<br \/>\nTechnology<\/p>\n<p>Computer networks have vast amount of data stored. This information can be processed anywhere, anytime. Wearable computing will provide access to remote computing as a result we can get the information without hunting for it. Wearables will allow to process routine tasks faster and more accurately from the field, eliminating the need of keyboards and screens.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Augmented Reality<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Wearables applications fall in the \u201caugmented reality\u201d category as they enhance what we see, hear, and touch so that we get more information presented in front of us. For instance, an auto mechanic can repair a vehicle with a heads-up display to get hands-free access to manuals or training videos.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Finally<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The commercial adoption of this technology could help discover new possibilities to gain business advantage. Wearables can dramatically reshape the way we do business.
