When we talk about applications, they are not just limited to mobile. With integrated smart devices commercially available in the market today, applications, as we know them, have had the luck to feature in a spin-off. The smart television market is expected to register a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mordorintelligence.com\/industry-reports\/smart-tv-market\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">CAGR of over 16.52 percent<\/a>, during the forecast period of 2018- 2023.

If you fail to make a solid plan on how do you plan on earning from the mobile app, your app idea might just go in vain, and keeping the app live on the store will be like beating a dead horse.<\/p>\n<p>Paying within the app is proving more sustainable with time than paying for the app. And there rests the case. Research has shown that people opt for a freemium model rather than paid versions of the app. People do not prefer to pay for the app before experiencing it.<\/p>\n<p>As an example, Google play store\u2019s revenue has seen exponential growth over the years. One notable aspect of this growth is that it\u2019s being driven entirely by freemium apps \u2014 free to download, but including paid in-app purchases. And this generates 98 percent of all revenues from Android apps and games.<\/p>\n<p>As an entrepreneur, one needs to understand that people are willing to invest their time, rather than money to try out a new app. And if users like your product, they would go ahead and pay for additional services.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Abstract speculation<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is safe to say that free apps are the way to go.

It is imperative to understand what your users want and enter the market accordingly. Why do certain apps generate more money and why the others are not fortunate enough to even get noticed by the users?<\/p>\n<p>A market, be it any existing system that you take into consideration, in its very fundamental level, works on emotions. Human emotions drive the foundation of any market. In this case, when we are talking about mobile apps: why will someone download a particular app and will they buy the premium services depends solely on the mood and the drive behind an individual\u2019s emotion.<\/p>\n<p>One cannot develop and publish an app simply based on the fact that the idea looks solid on paper and it has the potential to rock the market. When you are an entrepreneur who wants to run a business based on a mobile application, your emotions do not matter. You need to take care of your users\u2019 emotions, their needs, and their demands.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Doesn\u2019t matter if you are emotionally connected with your app idea or not, if your business is not practical and doesn\u2019t serve the purpose of solving an existing issue, chances of sustainability in the market are narrow in that case.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>When you understand this spectrum, you will understand why certain app categories are successful compared to others. These apps solve the problem for the users. They provide what users demand, what users want. These apps are there to satiate their user\u2019s fundamentally psychological needs and desires. When you touch that part of the human brain, you connect with your users. It gives birth to a sense of connection with your product.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Money_earning_apps_categories_generating_the_highest_revenue\"><\/span>Money earning apps categories generating the highest revenue<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Why are categories important?

Mobile applications are about addressing pain areas and unimaginably touching people\u2019s lives.<\/p>\n<p>To identify problems in your daily life and list each one of them.
