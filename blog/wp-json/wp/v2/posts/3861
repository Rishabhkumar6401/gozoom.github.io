Apple Pay is extremely safe and it removes the need for user-saved data. Data says that <strong>200 percent<\/strong> of the total payment made via the Apple payment gateway is expected to rise. Apple has started promoting the peer-to-peer gateway network for payment across its customers.<\/p>\n<p><strong>10. iBeacon<\/strong><br \/>\nThis is one of the most powerful technologies from Apple. And it is getting increasingly popular in marketing. So, what is iBeacon from Apple? Beacons are wireless transmitters that send signals using Bluetooth technology. Once the connection has been established, a push notification with a set message appears on the user\u2019s iPhone.<\/p>\n<p>Today, if a potential buyer is passing by the clothing store, as soon as customers pass by the shop, sensors placed inside the store connect to the smartphone and send a notification on her mobile about ongoing discounts, offers, and any information that the store owner wants the customer to see.<\/p>\n<p>This particular trend has changed the retail industry and boosted sales, and is not stopping anytime soon. As an example, the US departmental store Macy\u2019s has been using iBeacon technology for a long time now. Customers receive notifications about exciting deals and goods that they may be interested in whenever they pass by one of the Macy\u2019s stores.<\/p>\n<h4 style=\"font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 42px; color: #0a57f4;\">Conclusion<\/h4>\n<p>Internet of Things would grow much more than a mere buzzword.
