But what is Expo CLI? Expo is a tool built around React Native with a suite of features that allows writing React Native applications in a few minutes. It requires Node.js, phone and emulator. For those trying React Native directly in a web browser, you can try Snack.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"If_you_are_adept_with_mobile_development\"><\/span>If you are adept with mobile development<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>You may want to use React Native CLI, requiring Xcode or Android Studio to get started. It takes just a little more than an hour for installation and configuration.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"To_get_started_with_any_app_development_project\"><\/span>To get started with any app development project.<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>You need to create a project that you have already generated by using the CLI tool. Now, the next step is to gather the components to build an app.<\/p>\n<p>Components are the visual elements on the screen in a React Native App. When you partner with a trusted React Native app development company, you can easily overcome this step. However, we have covered the major components available to use by the React Native core.<\/p>\n<p>Basic or Core Components including Text, Image, View, ScrollView, TextInput, StyleSheet.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Components_for_listing_the_products_such_as_Flat_list_and_SectionList\"><\/span>Components for listing the products such as Flat list and SectionList.<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>UI Components to add functionality to your app are Picker, Slider, Button, Switch and more.<\/li>\n<li>Android-specific components such as ToastAndroid, ViewPagerAndroid, TimePickerAndroid, DatePickerAndroid<\/li>\n<li>iOS specific components including ActionSheetIOS, SegmentedControlIOS, AlertIOS, PushNotificationsIOS and more.<\/li>\n<li>Alert, Animated, CameraRoll, Dimensions, Clipboard, StatusBar, Keyboard, Linking, ActivityIndicator, WebView and Modal and more.<\/li>\n<li>Components and APIs available in React Native core that you can choose from the official documentation as per the need of the project.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>React Native allows developers to maintain the app and upgrade with more flexibility and ease.

If you are planning to build robust apps, don\u2019t reinvent the wheel. It is important to partner with a React App Development company. Here are the important questions to answer before you hire React developers.<\/p>\n<div>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"React_Native_Development_FAQ\"><\/span>React Native Development FAQ<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<div>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"What%E2%80%99s_the_Difference_Between_React_and_React_Native\"><\/span>What&#8217;s the Difference Between React and React Native?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>The difference is pretty straightforward. React is used for web apps and React Native to develop mobile apps. The main factor is that React is a library for web development on the other hand, React Native is a platform.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"When_to_Use_React_Native\"><\/span>When to Use React Native?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>React is the most feasible option when you want your apps to work on both Android and iOS operating systems. However, you want to keep one codebase only. Although React Native is gaining maturity and improving in terms of performance and robustness, it is providing a seemingly close experience to the truly native experience; there are still many differences.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Can_Existing_Apps_be_Migrated_to_React_Native\"><\/span>Can Existing Apps be Migrated to React Native?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>Does your app depend on heavy computing tasks on the device? The answer to this question will make things clear. React Native is evolving and growing at a rapid pace to build more and more rapid applications. Also, React Native migration makes your app easier and cost-effective to maintain. After all, there is only one codebase for both Android and iOS.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"What_are_Different_React_Native_Technologies\"><\/span>What are Different React Native Technologies?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>It&#8217;s good to know that several alternative technologies aspire to provide the same goals and have different ways of doing it. Here are some examples:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">NativeScript <\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cordova <\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flutter <\/span><\/li>\n<li>Xamarin<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"What_is_the_difference_between_React_and_React_Native\"><\/span>What is the difference between React and React Native?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>Before choosing React Native application development services, it is best to understand the difference between React and React Native. React is the framework used by JS, and React Native is the platform for native and cross-platform mobile application development. In addition, React.js is a library for building high-performance user interfaces. React Native essentially uses React and helps you access all the features React must provide.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Will_React_Native_apps_work_on_mobile_or_the_web\"><\/span>Will React Native apps work on mobile or the web?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>React Native is a platform-independent solution that can be used to develop Javascript applications. Mobile apps developed with React Native are considered cross-platform because they are built once and can be used across multiple platforms such as iOS, Android, and the web. React Native for the web is used to build apps that run on true web browsers and like true native mobile apps on iOS and Android.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Why_choose_React_Native_over_iOS_or_Android_app_development\"><\/span>Why choose React Native over iOS or Android app development?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>When building Android and iOS apps, you need to create the same app twice on both platforms from scratch. On the other hand, implementing React Native development services allows you to reuse the same code multiple times. With more effort, you can economically use the React Native app interface on Android and iOS. React Native also uses Flexbox as its layout, which works like Android. iOS and web apps. In terms of costs, the cost of developing an iOS or Android app is much higher than the cost of developing a React Native app.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"What_types_of_apps_do_you_build_with_React_Native\"><\/span>What types of apps do you build with React Native?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>Social media giant Facebook is one of the best examples of apps using React Native. Facebook Ads Manager partnered with React Native for the first time. Besides Facebook, Instagram (which also works with Facebook), Pinterest, Bloomberg, UberEats, Walmart, Tesla and many other well-known companies use the React Native framework for their apps.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"What_are_the_best_tools_for_React_Native\"><\/span>What are the best tools for React Native?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>React Native provides many tools that play a key role in accelerating application development and making the developer&#8217;s job easier. These tools can be divided into two categories, as described below.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Visual Studio Code:<\/strong> Provides an excellent platform for building applications according to the needs of users and developers.
