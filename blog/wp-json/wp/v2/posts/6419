This discouraged consumers from using wearables. However, wearables now are getting smaller and highly advanced. Many wearables are designed such that they can be used as accessories and on different parts of the body making wearable either fashionable or undetectable. Wearables have turned out to be so tiny that they are almost invisible under your clothes or even on your body.<\/p>\n<p>The main goal of this trend is to make devices more compact and lightweight, and consequently agile and affordable for every person. The relatively smaller devices are, the more likely people will engage.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Paradigm_Shift_to_Preventive_Approach\"><\/span>Paradigm Shift to Preventive Approach<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>This is especially true in healthcare.
