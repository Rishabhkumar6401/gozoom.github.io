Out of the several innovations being used to transform technology services, Augmented Reality (AR) comes across as a game changing technology.<\/p>\n<p>Considering the rising expectations regarding access to healthcare facilities and healthcare delivery, nowadays a specialist <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/augmented-reality-application-development.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Augmented Reality App Development Company<\/strong><\/a> is completely focused on providing AR solutions. Augmented reality is the use of displays, cameras, and sensors to overlay digital information on the real world. It is the immersive experience which is building up AR as a futuristic innovation in the healthcare sector. Whenever time is of essence, AR technology allows sharing of information and access to information in the most immersive manner.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/covid-19-business-continuity-plans.html?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_campaign=covid-10&amp;utm_term=Enterprise%20IT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter pdimgauto size-full wp-image-7737\" src=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/enterprise-it-and-technology-solutions.jpg\" alt=\"Enterprise IT and Technology Solutions during Covid-19\" width=\"728\" height=\"90\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/enterprise-it-and-technology-solutions.jpg 728w, https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/enterprise-it-and-technology-solutions-300x37.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The AR and VR healthcare market is predicted to be worth about $5.1 billion in a few years, with 3.4 million users worldwide according to a report by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.goldmansachs.com\/insights\/pages\/technology-driving-innovation-folder\/virtual-and-augmented-reality\/report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Goldman-Sachs<\/a>. The future of these technologies in the healthcare industry is believed to be in enhanced user experiences and increased mobility.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Advantages_of_Augmented_Reality_in_Healthcare_Technology_Solutions\"><\/span>Advantages of Augmented Reality in Healthcare Technology Solutions<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><strong>Enhancing access<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Access to healthcare information has traditionally been restricted to the availability of a practitioner for each patient in face-to-face consultation in surgery waiting rooms and so on. The concept of telemedicine is providing access to information in a reliable manner over phone, internet and smart devices.<\/p>\n<p>In such scenarios, AR can aid such consultations, especially in the field of surgery facilitating surgical procedures to be carried out over different geographic locations with a specialist surgeon using AR tools to guide and collaborate with a colleague based in different location in real time. The easy ease to information means can improve access to information.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Training and Development<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Skilled medical staff is an asset for the healthcare industry and equally important is the need to constantly train professionals. AR comes across as an effective way of creating a highly engaging experience with different sensory inputs, aids retention and how well complex concepts can be grasped<\/p>\n<p>A key benefit of AR as a learning tool is that it creates a highly engaging, immersive educational experience which aids retention and ability to grasp complex concepts.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Assisting Practice<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>From aiding diagnosis process to assisting with training, AR is an extremely helpful tool in aiding medical professionals complete day-to-day tasks more accurately and efficiently. Several AR apps allows processes like project anatomical cross sections onto a patient, or 3D visualisations of internal organs, so the surgeon gets a real view as they plan a procedure.<\/p>\n<p>Several <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/ar-vr-app-development.html\">AR apps<\/a> enable professionals to find veins for cannulation, as well as incorporate electronic restorative records (EMR) being naturally shown on a gadget as a specialist looks at or counsels with a patient, again featuring the immersive nature of AR for the healthcare industry.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Engaging patients<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Another interesting pattern we are seeing with the utilization of AR in healhtcare is the improvement of uses that enable patients to assume an increasingly proactive role in the managing their own health and welfare. Several AR apps provide a unique perspective of a 3D anatomical representation, demonstrating the structure of the eyeball. These AR solutions also offer visual simulations of complex eye conditions<\/p>\n<p>Free on iPhone or iPad, clients can self-analyze by coordinating the reenactment to any bending they are encountering in their very own vision, and the application at that point even offers a rundown of proposed eye surgeons.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"AR_Eliminating_Challenges_and_Bottlenecks\"><\/span>AR: Eliminating Challenges and Bottlenecks<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Like any new technology, companies need to understand the advantages and disadvantages of AR adoption. AR can open new avenues and business model possibilities for companies, as well as new products and services, faster prototyping, enhanced design and training, increased efficiencies, improved safety and cost savings. However, there are several loopholes. Several companies lack digital skills to execute these technologies in a correct manner. There is also risk of fragmentation and risks associated with conflicting capabilities across hardware platforms and operating systems.<\/p>\n<p>There are technical barriers and cost is another issue. Plus, there are hazards related to business operations that come with adopting VR or AR. It is important to assess your business objectives to ensure that you are on the path of technology innovation.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Finally<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Healthcare is a burgeoning industry and emerging technology solutions &#8211; now given a boost by Augmented reality is helping the industry expand. It also offers more transparency for diagnosis and treatment, update their health records, find health information and connect to remote monitoring devices while improving health outcomes, reducing costs and helping differentiate providers from the competition.<\/p>\n<div id=\"ez-toc-container\" class=\"ez-toc-v2_0_47_1 ez-toc-wrap-left counter-hierarchy ez-toc-counter ez-toc-transparent ez-toc-container-direction\">\n<div class=\"ez-toc-title-container\">\n<p class=\"ez-toc-title\">Table of Contents<\/p>\n<span class=\"ez-toc-title-toggle\"><\/span><\/div>\n<nav><ul class='ez-toc-list ez-toc-list-level-1 ' ><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/blog\/augmented-reality-in-healthcare-advantages-and-challenges.html\/#Advantages_of_Augmented_Reality_in_Healthcare_Technology_Solutions\" title=\"Advantages of Augmented Reality in Healthcare Technology Solutions\">Advantages of Augmented Reality in Healthcare Technology Solutions<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-2\" href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/blog\/augmented-reality-in-healthcare-advantages-and-challenges.html\/#AR_Eliminating_Challenges_and_Bottlenecks\" title=\"AR: Eliminating Challenges and Bottlenecks\">AR: Eliminating Challenges and Bottlenecks<\/a><\/li><\/ul><\/nav><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As the population continues to grow exponentially and individuals live more and more, social insurance and health insurance related benefits across the world over are consistently expanding its footprints.
