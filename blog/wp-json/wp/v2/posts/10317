But what exactly is low code development? How does it work? Why should you consider using a low code development platform to build your next application?<\/p>\n<p>This post explains what low code development software is and how it can help you in all stages of the software development lifecycle, from concept to deployment and beyond.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"What_is_low_code_development\"><\/span>What is low code development?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Low-code, or no-code, development isn\u2019t a new concept. But as with many fields that develop at breakneck speed, it\u2019s one that still requires clarification for those outside of its immediate scope\u2014and what better place to start than with a definition?<\/p>\n<p><strong>47 billion US dollars<br \/>\n<\/strong>Global revenue from the low-code development platform market in 2025<\/p>\n<p><strong>5.8 million US dollars<br \/>\n<\/strong>Global revenue from low-code application platforms in 2021<\/p>\n<p><strong>100%<\/strong><br \/>\nLow-code enterprises have received ROI from their low-code adoption.<\/p>\n<p>Low-code or no-code platforms allow businesses to create custom applications without the need for in-house developers to code. This can be done by directly creating an application through drag-and-drop functionality or by creating building blocks (known as microservices) that are then connected together to form an application.<\/p>\n<p>In either case, these building blocks can be easily changed or rearranged to suit changing business needs\u2014without any need for coding knowledge on behalf of your team.<\/p>\n<p>An emerging approach to building software, called low-code or no-code development, is empowering business users to quickly develop customized applications without significant coding. With these platforms, developers can configure a wide range of application components like databases, data sources, business rules, and user interfaces with little to no technical skills.<\/p>\n<p>The immediate benefits include faster time to market and lower maintenance costs.<\/p>\n<p>For some types of apps, these developments represent a seismic shift in how we think about IT\u2014and could be as revolutionary as the PC was 30 years ago.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Low-code_development_represents_another_leap_forward_in_technology\"><\/span>Low-code development represents another leap forward in technology<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>It will change what\u2019s possible for businesses. It\u2019s easy to see why many businesses are eager to take advantage of such an approach. Low-code or no-code platforms allow you to create custom solutions by dragging and dropping prebuilt functionality into place.<\/p>\n<p>This means less upfront work on your part (i.e., fewer hours spent writing code), but more importantly, it means you get an app up and running much quicker than if you had hired a developer or used traditional tools like Visual Studio.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Pega_low-code_development_The_benefits_of_no-code_development\"><\/span>Pega low-code development: The benefits of no-code development<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>When businesses start working with Pega low-code development, they are often surprised at the benefits of this approach to software creation. This development paradigm allows businesses to get the best <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/ios-application-development.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">iOS app development services<\/a> with only a few lines of code, saving development costs and time in the process. Let\u2019s take a look at the advantages of no-code development and why it can be so powerful in your business toolkit.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Reduces_errors\"><\/span>Reduces errors<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>If there are mistakes in your code, you might not notice them until a lot of time and money has been spent on development. By switching to Pega\u2019s low-code software design process, you can program by pointing and clicking rather than typing complex computer codes. If you need to make edits, you can do so quickly\u2014often in a matter of minutes or even seconds.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Accelerates_time_to_market\"><\/span>Accelerates time to market<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>In most cases, Pega enables you to develop an application much faster than traditional coding methods. Low-code and no-code applications can typically be deployed in weeks instead of months. In addition, because there\u2019s less effort involved in creating applications through a visual drag and drop interface rather than writing code from scratch, it also reduces costs associated with developing new applications.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Promotes_fast_technology_adoption\"><\/span>Promotes fast technology adoption<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Pega makes it possible for business people to implement and adapt to new technologies at a rapid pace. By allowing users to focus on their unique processes, programs can be created without coding, which means there\u2019s less need for IT developers or extensive training. Because Pega is so easy to use, your whole company\u2014not just dedicated tech teams\u2014can become innovators.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Enables_rapid_feature_development_and_deployment\"><\/span>Enables rapid feature development and deployment<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Pega enables business users to develop new and innovative applications in a fraction of the time it takes for traditional systems. With only a small amount of training, users can create their own web-based applications on Pega. This allows businesses to accelerate product development and bring their offerings to market quicker than ever before.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Provides_transparency_with_automation_data\"><\/span>Provides transparency with automation data<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Advanced automation users can program robots to complete repetitive tasks and then track changes in data by following a continuous audit trail through all stages of a robot&#8217;s process. This gives teams real-time insight into data and allows them to adapt immediately based on changing trends. No matter how many departments an organization has, it\u2019s easy for anyone involved in an automated process to monitor data changes, even when robots aren\u2019t behaving as expected.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Allows_for_greater_agility_in_production_teams\"><\/span>Allows for greater agility in production teams<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Low-code and no-code environments increase an organization\u2019s agility. It is estimated that 70% of businesses are continuously creating new applications to solve customer needs. With Pega low-code development, IT teams can prioritize new application deployments over updating existing systems. This makes for a faster, more agile production team.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"When_should_you_use_low-code_or_no-code_development\"><\/span>When should you use low-code or no-code development?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re just getting started with developing apps, a low-code platform can help you create something more quickly. And with a learning curve of about one week, building apps in a low-code environment can be easier to learn than going straight into coding. Low-code platforms are particularly good for teams where only some developers know how to write code, or where business needs change frequently.<\/p>\n<p>This flexibility is what makes them ideal for developing applications that must adapt to changing customer needs. In addition, since they work within an existing IT infrastructure, they require less time and money to implement. They also make it easy to add new users as your team grows.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_to_build_a_low_code_application\"><\/span>How to build a low code application<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Low-code platforms are quickly gaining traction with organizations looking to cut costs, improve time to market, or implement agile methodologies. Low-code platforms enable business users to access a library of available applications that help them solve common problems. And, because of their simplified design, they can also allow businesses to reach more customers by implementing more customized solutions.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re interested in building an application but not in tackling all of its complexities, a low-code platform might be right for you.<\/p>\n<p>A low-code platform (or rapid application development [RAD] tool) allows developers to create custom apps without writing lines of code, making it easy for nontechnical staff members to use as well. In fact, many low-code platforms can create entire apps without any coding at all.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"A_step-by-step_guide_to_building_a_low_code_application\"><\/span>A step-by-step guide to building a low code application<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Low code platforms are gaining popularity among businesses looking to enhance the productivity of their employees and streamline their development process. While there are some low code platforms that require developers, others are geared toward non-technical users and allow these users to drag and drop modules into place in order to create their application functionality.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Research_your_target_market\"><\/span>Research your target market<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>When it comes to software development, your product or service needs to be profitable for you. What\u2019s your target market? Are there any trends in your industry you can capitalize on? These are things you need to know before you start coding.<\/p>\n<p>Find out who will be using your product and why they will need it. If possible, get feedback from them. The more information you have at hand when making decisions related to design and function, the better off you\u2019ll be.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Work_out_which_platforms_and_channels_you_want_to_focus_on\"><\/span>Work out which platforms and channels you want to focus on<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Before you begin, get clear on which channels and platforms are right for your idea. For example, if you want to build an app that offers remote tech support services, it makes sense to target users with no coding experience (low code) who also use mobile phones (mobile apps). If you have in-house web development skills or know how to hire an outsourced team, then you can also consider high-coding platforms such as PCs and websites.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Determine_what_your_business_model_will_be\"><\/span>Determine what your business model will be<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Low-code platforms vary greatly when it comes to business models. Many are priced on an annual subscription basis, but some also offer licenses for individual modules within an application. If you\u2019re still deciding on a business model, talk with potential customers and partners to help you make your decision.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Design_your_app\"><\/span>Design your app<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>The design is going to make or break your app. Of course, what you\u2019re creating will determine which elements of design are most important, but making sure you have a killer UI\/UX is crucial. Unfortunately, creating an awesome user experience requires time and resources\u2014and those are two things that startups typically don\u2019t have in abundance.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Build_your_MVP_Minimum_Viable_Product\"><\/span>Build your MVP (Minimum Viable Product)<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>The quickest way to test your idea is often to build a minimum viable product (MVP). This will give you something real and working, but simple and free of all bells and whistles. In fact, it doesn\u2019t even have to be an app! If your business depends on customers communicating in person or writing emails, then a website can be your MVP.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Get_users_on_board\"><\/span>Get users on board<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Before you start building, you need to get users. You might have an initial group of seed users in mind, or maybe you know where and how to recruit them (on social media, via email, etc.). But if not, now is your chance. What platforms will help you reach potential users? (e.g., Twitter). How can you market your product so that people are more likely to sign up for it?<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Enhance_your_app_with_new_features_based_on_feedback_from_users\"><\/span>Enhance your app with new features based on feedback from users<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>In today\u2019s competitive marketplace, it\u2019s essential that you continually use feedback from customers to enhance your app. With user experience (UX) at an all-time high in terms of importance, you need to be iterating on your app continuously. That doesn\u2019t mean you need to do daily pushes. It just means that you should consistently be adding new features based on what people have said they want and need.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Why_use_low_code_development\"><\/span>Why use low code development?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Low-code platforms are often designed to be simpler than traditional enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. Because they\u2019re a lot easier to navigate, employees can use them on their own, eliminating much of a company\u2019s IT department\u2019s workload. This translates into fewer dollars spent on overhead like training or implementation fees.<\/p>\n<p>It also means that you don\u2019t have to wait for someone else to get your system up and running\u2014you can start using it right away. It\u2019s a win-win situation for everyone involved.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Best_low-code_development_platforms_in_2022\"><\/span>Best low-code development platforms in 2022<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Zoho Creator<\/li>\n<li>Visual LANSA<\/li>\n<li>Knack<\/li>\n<li>Bubble<\/li>\n<li>Mendix<\/li>\n<li>Quickbase<\/li>\n<li>Retool<\/li>\n<li>Airtable<\/li>\n<li>Microsoft PowerApps<\/li>\n<li>Caspio<\/li>\n<li>OutSystems<\/li>\n<li>Quixy<\/li>\n<li>Creatio<\/li>\n<li>GeneXus<\/li>\n<li>Web.com<\/li>\n<li>Appian<\/li>\n<li>KiSSFLOW \u2013 BPM &amp; Workflow Software<\/li>\n<li>Salesforce Lightning<\/li>\n<li>AppSheet<\/li>\n<li>Google App Maker<\/li>\n<li>FileMaker<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Low-code_Development_Use_Cases\"><\/span>Low-code Development: Use Cases<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Here are a few useful examples where you can use low code development:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Small-scale automation<\/li>\n<li>Analytics<\/li>\n<li>Websites and mobile applications<\/li>\n<li>Mobile apps<\/li>\n<li>Customer portals<\/li>\n<li>Configuration and device set-up<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Low-code_platforms_A_Caveat\"><\/span>Low-code platforms: A Caveat<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Because they\u2019re designed for non-technical users, they lack many of the features available in high-end development tools like Java or .NET. In addition, because they don&#8217;t support all programming languages, if you need a tool that uses a language not supported by your low-code platform (such as NodeJS), you&#8217;ll have to go back to writing code from scratch\u2014or switch tools entirely.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Finally\"><\/span>Finally<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>A business owner\u2019s #1 concern is getting new software for their organization. Without it, they can&#8217;t make important decisions quickly, help customers more effectively or scale their business. Low-code and no-code platforms give users high productivity and flexibility with little IT involvement.<\/p>\n<p>A good platform will help you build applications faster, run them better and connect everything in your organization. While all three areas are critical to success, it\u2019s ultimately about customer experience \u2013 whether B2B or B2C.<\/p>\n<div id=\"ez-toc-container\" class=\"ez-toc-v2_0_47_1 ez-toc-wrap-left
