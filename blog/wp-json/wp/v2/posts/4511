With the mass adoption of mobile technology in the United States (predicted to rise from 96.2 million in 2015 to 105.4 million mobile workers in 2020), it has cultivated an environment where workers expect to leverage mobile technology at work.<\/p>\n<p>This is encouraging more and more companies to implement enterprise BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) programs.<br \/>\nBYOD usage globally is set to grow 20 percent in 2016, and 72% of organizations are permitting BYOD or planning to do so. Gartner predicts that BYOD programs will continue to become more conventional with 38 percent of companies likely to stop providing devices to workers by 2016. Check out the proven BYOD trends businesses can choose to follow:<\/p>\n<p><b><span style=\"color: #218e45; font-size: large;\">Get Ready For More Apps\/Cloud Resources!<\/span><\/b><\/p>\n<p>BYOD is not just about corporate email, but can be much more than that (including apps and cloud resources are already available to connect people via devices for business purposes). Most businesses are now harnessing the power of third-party mobile applications that play a role in BYOD for internal users to get stuff done through collaboration, shared tasks, information repositories and better communication.<\/p>\n<p><b><span style=\"color: #218e45; font-size: large;\">Cost-to-Company to decrease<\/span><\/b><\/p>\n<p>While most companies earlier had to reimburse employees for using their personal devices to conduct business operations, the implementation of BYOD will nullify that perspective \u2013 as devices to be used for corporate requirement will be considered a part of staff requirements.<\/p>\n<p><b><span style=\"color: #218e45; font-size: large;\">Take the IoT advantage<\/span><\/b><\/p>\n<p>BYOD has now moved beyond just being about smartphones and tablets. As the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/blog\/internet-of-things-in-business-more-than-a-buzzword.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Internet of Things<\/a> (IOT) continue to make way into the BYOD realm \u2013 all thanks to sensors, wearables, environmental monitors, etc. it\u2019s time for policymakers to identify how these can fit into company strategy.<\/p>\n<p><b><span style=\"color: #218e45; font-size: large;\">Unified strategy beckons<\/span><\/b><\/p>\n<p>With growing complexity, all you need to manage BYOD is discipline and strategy. While IT departments will require to plan and map out how they can handle variations in BYOD, it is also important at the same time to define guidelines and requirements for use, and ensure that suitable administration, monitoring, and support controls are in place to rise to the business new challenges.<\/p>\n<p><b><span style=\"color: #218e45; font-size: large;\">When Storage becomes an issue!<\/span><\/b><\/p>\n<p>Here the problem is not related to storage costs or limitations as such, but is related to Company files wind up \u2013 thanks to local and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/amazon-web-services-aws.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cloud storage options<\/a> on devices. Mostly it is found that users inevitably save a document locally and are later unable to find it later on their desktop, if in case they mistakenly deleted the message. This problem can be solved by using centralized cloud storage that synchronizes documents across various devices, both personal and company-owned.<\/p>\n<p><b><span style=\"color: #218e45; font-size: large;\">Stringent Security measures<\/span><\/b><\/p>\n<p>Security will remain a prime concern if BYOD is implemented at workplace. Besides IT departments having to take stringent measures to ensure that sensitive company information is protected, the convenience and cost savings of BYOD have always resulted in a security tradeoff and trends indicate that this is only going to become more prominent in 2016.<\/p>\n<p><b><span style=\"color: #218e45; font-size: large;\">Cannot Alienate Employees from Business<\/span><\/b><\/p>\n<p>Employee\u2019s part ways from a Company, but with BYOD in place at workplace, it becomes all the more important to ensure that confidential company data is stored in safe hands and do not pass on to anyone\u2019s personal account. This can be done by forming stringent, and viable corporate policies and legal controls that take preference over any technological measures that can be implemented.<\/p>\n<p><b><span style=\"color: #218e45; font-size: large;\">Set up Condition for BYOD use<\/span><\/b><\/p>\n<p>While employees love the idea of BYOD at workplace, stringent policies are implemented and rules are to be followed so as to ensure data protection. So, on the eventuality of employee termination from services, the company reserves the right to remotely wipe any BYOD-connected devices hooked to the Company, or manually verify deletion of all company information before the employee cuts off all ties with the organization.<\/p>\n<p><b><span style=\"color: #218e45; font-size: large;\">It\u2019s no longer a privilege \u2013 but a Requirement!<\/span><\/b><\/p>\n<p>With Gartner predicting half of employers around the world to implement BYOD by the end of 2016, employees can expect to see companies authorizing that they use their own devices at workplace for company work.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover with global economies blurring geographical borders to create a virtual world where brick-and-mortar organization continue to fade in prominence; companies just starting out can see real gains from BYOD as companies do not consider it as a privilege but a requirement to simplify business processes.<\/p>\n<p><b>Is your Company ready to embrace BYOD in 2016?
