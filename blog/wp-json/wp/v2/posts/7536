For general communities to follow if you need an app developer are Koding or Polycom. It is also a good idea to check official groups of Google, Facebook, Apple, Windows developers. But do not let this engulf you, instead try to <strong>hire an app developer<\/strong> as suitable and promising for your project as possible.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"color: #000; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 40px;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Here%E2%80%99s_what_you_could_also_do\"><\/span>Here\u2019s what you could also do.<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>As you start looking to hire a mobile app developer, you\u2019ll see the places for finding them as well. There\u2019s no dearth of remote <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/hire-mobile-app-developers.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mobile app developers for hire<\/a> around the globe. Whatever skillset, technical expertise or price range, there is a developer for each and every project. However, there are several flipsides to selecting a mobile app developer.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"color: #000; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 40px;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"So_before_you_start_your_quest_here_are_chief_reasons_you_should_stick_to\"><\/span>So before you start your quest, here are chief reasons you should stick to:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"padding: 10px 0;\"><strong>Understand the fundamentals:<\/strong> It is important to be aware of types of programming languages to build a mobile app. You can finalize the platforms upon studying the preferences of your target audience and your targeted platform(s) to build an app. Check the rates and how much it would cost you to hire an app developer (even approximately). Also find the possible types of users of your app.<\/li>\n<li style=\"padding: 10px 0;\"><strong>Check Experience:<\/strong> If you are looking to hire a remote mobile app developer, it is critical to check the portfolio of mobile apps. The developer should be not just a top-expert, but also should be able to provide the portfolio of prior work. Don&#8217;t hesitate to ask for samples of his\/her code. The same applies to your business \u2013 hire a developer who knows the technical side, as well as business logic.<\/li>\n<li style=\"padding: 10px 0;\"><strong>Build relationship and communication:<\/strong> Don\u2019t just hire developers based on technical skills. Seek developer who aligns with your business needs and goals. You\u2019ll have to be in sync with the developer to build a relationship with each other to get your app going. Language or cultural barriers, for instance can get in your way as obstacles.\n<p style=\"padding-top: 10px;\">Robust communication is one the most important aspects of the development process. Understand different time zones and communication tools such as email, Skype, and phone.<\/p>\n<ul style=\"margin-left: 30px;\">\n<li>Specific hours of communication with the developer<\/li>\n<li>Flexibility to communicate or call anytime<\/li>\n<li>Project methodology<\/li>\n<li>Ability to supervise the work progress or manage team remotely<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li style=\"padding: 10px 0;\"><strong>Know Developer Terms: <\/strong>Don\u2019t make fees and payment terms the only criterion of hiring your developer. Secondly, don\u2019t go with the cheapest option. Unrealistically low prices mean cutting corners when it comes to quality. You don\u2019t want to manage an app infested with bugs or technical glitches. It is vital to decipher any hidden fees, overtimes, additional costs before you kick start the project. No one needs surprises in costs.<\/li>\n<li style=\"padding: 10px 0;\"><strong>Focus on the overall persona<\/strong>: When you build an app, it is not just about coding. You are also creating a functional design and thinking about the user experience as well. Do not go on selecting an independent developer until and unless you already have access to a team who will perform the rest of the functions such as design, usability and testing.<\/li>\n<li style=\"padding: 10px 0;\"><strong>Focus on design aspect<\/strong>: The way a website or an app looks is as important as how it works. You should go a step further and look at partners who can add value to the usability aspect of your website or mobile app, which will define how users interact with your product.<\/li>\n<li style=\"padding: 10px 0;\"><strong>Look at the cultural fit<\/strong>: Even if this sounds a bit hippie, culture fit is a genuinely important part of the equation when you are hiring app developers.The process of app development is a long process that requires a lot of coordination in the team. Your team doesn\u2019t need to think the same way about every issue in this world.However, they do have to be able to overcome challenges constructively, even when there are differences in opinions and approaches; especially when time is the most crucial aspect.This can be made possible in an environment which has the ability to foster a healthy relationship between the employees.This relationship extends to upper management as well. Developing an app puts a lot of time, money, and energy on the line. Bottom line, you want to do it with a team who wants the app to succeed as badly as you do.<\/li>\n<li style=\"padding: 10px 0;\"><strong>Gather info about SDLC<\/strong>: Make sure you gather as much information about the project development process. Inspect methodologies, frameworks and approaches applied (e.g. Scrum, Kanban), development and design guidelines (for iOS, Android apps), and allocation of a Project Manager. You should check the communication and feedback procedures during all app development stages. You should also check how quickly the team is able to react to potential issues and perform quality assurance.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"iOS_Developer_for_Hire\"><\/span>iOS Developer for Hire<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>When it comes to the number of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/276623\/number-of-apps-available-in-leading-app-stores\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">available apps in the biggest app stores<\/a>, Google Play and the Apple App Store lead the ranking with 3.8 million and 2 million available apps respectively. According to mobile app developers and publishers, nearly most of the majority of apps are free to download.<\/p>\n<p>Considering the rapidly increasing user base of iPhone apps, the demand for iPhone app developers is high in demand and can be a costly affair compared to industry average. In such a scenario, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/hire-iphone-app-developers.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hiring iOS developers<\/a> is what you should do only if your app is mostly or fully made for the Apple market. Look for candidates in specialized communities:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"margin-left: 30px;\">\n<li>Monitor online activity<\/li>\n<li>Review blog posts and Twitter to share code contributions on Github.<\/li>\n<li>Ask what libraries and components would use to build your app.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Android_Developer_for_Hire\"><\/span>Android Developer for Hire<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The same principle applies with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/hire-android-app-developers.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Android app developers for hire<\/a>. However, there is a fundamental difference when it comes to specifics about Android app developers. First, Android applications are based on Java. So it is important to find skills in this programming language. Gone are the days when Java alone was enough. Good base of Android open source ecosystem and libraries is equally important.<\/p>\n<ul style=\"margin-left: 30px;\">\n<li>Background in Java Native interface<\/li>\n<li>Ability to handle all the different Android versions and APIs<\/li>\n<li>Knowledge of publishing an app to Google Play and app promotion<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4 style=\"font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 42px; color: #0a57f4;\">Finally<\/h4>\n<p>Mobile is the future and it is going to stay.
