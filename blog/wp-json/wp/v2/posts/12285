By secretly stealing a visitor&#8217;s session ID, hackers can gain unauthorized access to sensitive information, such as login credentials or personal data.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This type of attack is particularly problematic because it can be difficult to detect by traditional security measures like firewalls and antivirus software.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To prevent this, it is important to bind the session ID to other user or client properties. This makes it harder for attackers to hijack the session, as they would need access to all the properties used in the binding mechanism.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"XSS_Attacks\"><\/span><b>XSS Attacks<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attack is a common vulnerability that can occur when a website accepts user input and outputs it directly to the webpage.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hackers can exploit this vulnerability by submitting malicious code, such as JavaScript, HTML, or even CSS, to the website.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, developers can protect against this frequent XSS attack by sanitizing the data that is received by the website.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Ubiquitous_Benefits_for_Enterprises_by_Using_PHP_Applications\"><\/span><b>Ubiquitous Benefits for Enterprises by Using PHP Applications<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-12290 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Benefits-of-Using-a-PHP-Application.webp\" alt=\"Advantages of PHP\" width=\"908\" height=\"550\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Benefits-of-Using-a-PHP-Application.webp 908w, https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Benefits-of-Using-a-PHP-Application-300x182.webp 300w, https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Benefits-of-Using-a-PHP-Application-768x465.webp 768w, https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Benefits-of-Using-a-PHP-Application-150x91.webp 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 908px) 100vw, 908px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Simplified_Product_Management\"><\/span><b>Simplified Product Management<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To stay competitive, e-commerce business portals can utilize the power of PHP to offer a wide range of features, including discounted prices, calculated shipping costs, and streamlined sales tax collection.
