However, tech experts are introducing new innovations and unlocking several possibilities to maintain a healthy lifestyle.<\/p>\n<p>In CES 2020, many innovations are announced. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/timbajarin\/2020\/01\/13\/personalized-healthcare-technology-on-display-at-ces-2020\/#1ba77ed49a9c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">According to Forbes,<\/a> the digital health monitoring market is projected to grow to $245.5 billion by 2024, and that will be driven by a lot of new advances in health monitoring devices that are wearable.<\/p>\n<p>Now with an iPhone or Android phone like the one from Dario, we even have digital thermometers and digital scales that can determine body mass index, which helps to monitor sugar and blood pressure readings.<\/p>\n<p>In the past few years, with the help of video conferencing doctors were able to visit remotely to the patients but still, the real signs were not much clear and doctors were not able to diagnose with real-time health data. To turn the remote visits into reality, now <a href=\"https:\/\/medwand.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MedWand<\/a> will provide multiple, diagnostic tools in a single, easy-to-use handheld device. This will help to record patients\u2019 vital signs and provide real-time health data to the doctors.<\/p>\n<p>Health mobile apps lead to sleep smarter, faster, and staying asleep longer. It fixes a healthy sleep routine.<\/p>\n<p>The development of telemedicine can be considered to be one of the most remarkable contributions of technology. Such technological innovations have been even handier in the current times owing to the outbreak of the global pandemic. With the norms of physical distancing, patients can now avoid visiting health centers physically and get themselves treated at home.<\/p>\n<p>Telemedicine has helped in developing a platform to connect health experts and patients for treatment. Thus, the smart wearables with microsensors, telemedicine, 3D reporting have all emerged as a response to technological advancement and have ensured a better patient-centric approach in healthcare systems. The 3D reporting system has enhanced the quality of treatment administered to patients as it offers a greater understanding of the disease through a three-dimensional view of the body. Such reports are extremely beneficial for treating wounds that might look minor or maybe ignored otherwise.<\/p>\n<p>Rapid technological advancement has also introduced the use of cloud computing in healthcare units that have facilitated the systematic storage of data. Thus, hospitals and healthcare units need not worry about storing and analyzing their data in a manual process. The implementation of cloud computing technologies and storage removes the chances of human error and ensures better and safer storage of data sources.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"color: #000; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 40px;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Safety-Assistance_Apps\"><\/span>Safety-Assistance Apps<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Safety-assistance apps that alert drivers to vehicles in their blind spots or help them park automatically should be a boon to consumers, said <a href=\"https:\/\/www.seattletimes.com\/business\/technology\/a-glimpse-of-our-connected-tech-future-courtesy-of-ces-2020\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Carolina Milanesi<\/a>, a technology analyst for Creative Strategies.<\/p>\n<p>In CES, new auto safety features gained a lot of attention and experts have found it the most useful point in the event.<\/p>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/01\/10\/technology\/ces-2020.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">New York Times,<\/a> \u201cSamsung showed a car equipped with its Exynos Auto V9 computing processor, which can run applications on multiple screens and pull information from up to 12 cameras.
