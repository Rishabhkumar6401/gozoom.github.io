In fact, MERN\u2019s UI rendering capabilities rival those of some of the most popular frameworks, such as React and Angular. This makes MERN a perfect choice for developers who are seeking a sophisticated yet easy-to-use platform.&nbsp; Furthermore, MERN is platform agnostic, which means that it can be used to build applications for both web and mobile platforms.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Third-party\"><\/span>Third-party<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-11145\" src=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/third-party.jpg\" alt=\"MEAN development Third party integration support\" width=\"908\" height=\"441\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/third-party.jpg 908w, https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/third-party-300x146.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/third-party-768x373.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 908px) 100vw, 908px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MEAN Stack also offers developers more control over third-party extensions. With MEAN, developers can easily \u2018plug-and-play\u2019 with third-party extensions, making it easier to integrate these extensions into an application. MERN, on the other hand, requires additional setup when integrating third-party extensions. This means that developers need to write additional code to make sure that the integration is seamless and error-free.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Crud_applications\"><\/span>Crud applications<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With MERN, you can create and deploy a CRUD application from start to finish. This makes it a perfect choice for developers who are looking to create a simple yet functional application. Additionally, MERN is platform agnostic, which means that it can be used to build applications for both web and mobile platforms.
