From remote workers and customer experiences to supply chain management, the digital-first culture created during the pandemic necessitated a shift in how companies operated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Digital transformation allows organizations to reimagine how their business is run through new <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/business-delivery-models.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b><i>digital processes<\/i><\/b><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and tools. By using digital technologies and tools, organizations can improve efficiency and decreases costs associated with traditional techniques and systems. This can lead to increased profitability and better customer service.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><em><b>The direct digital transformation investment market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 18% from 2020 to 2023.<\/b><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the wake of the pandemic, many businesses have had to pivot to a digital-first culture. This has led to increased pressures on IT teams, and as a result, many employees have left or changed roles. To be successful in this new world, senior IT leaders have had to evolve from operators to business leaders with deep technical expertise.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Digital transformation is changing an organization&#8217;s business model and its processes to make it more effective and responsive to the demands of the digital age. It is a complicated process, and there are several challenges businesses will face throughout the digital transformation processes, ranging from people-centric issues, structural problems, technical barriers, and everything in between. However, with the right strategy and team, businesses can successfully transition to the digital age.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"What_defines_Digital_Transformation\"><\/span>What defines Digital Transformation?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the business world, the term digital transformation is used a lot. But what does it mean? Simply put, digital transformation is integrating digital technology into all areas of a business resulting in fundamental changes to how businesses operate and deliver value to customers. It&#8217;s also a cultural change that requires organizations to challenge their traditional way of doing business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As <strong>technology <\/strong><\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/internet-of-things-iot.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b>advances<\/b><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, so too must businesses. They must break free of their reliance on outdated methods and embrace digital transformation. This will empower the organization to take their business into the future, position companies to withstand competition, and grow into new areas. The internet provides a wealth of opportunities for companies willing to take the plunge and digitize their operations.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Why_Is_Digital_Transformation_difficult\"><\/span>Why Is Digital Transformation difficult?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Digital transformation is more than adopting new software and technologies; it&#8217;s an entirely new way of doing business that is core to your success. Many businesses are now embracing digital transformation to stay competitive. This process involves adopting new software, technologies, and more efficient and automated techniques than traditional business practices and methods.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Digital transformations are complex, and organizations must consider everything when taking on the challenge, from how people will react to the change, how it will impact customer relations, the cost, how it will align with business goals, and more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most organizations believe that digital transformation means deploying upcoming technologies with a wayward attitude, but the reality is quite different. Organizations struggling to keep up with the digital age are often quick to deploy new technologies without adequately testing them. This often leads to disastrous outcomes, such as <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/blockchain-development.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b><i>data breaches<\/i><\/b><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and lost productivity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The following blog will help you understand the significant challenges that companies could face while implementing digital transformation projects in 2023 and beyond.<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Challenges_implementing_digital_transformation_in_the_future_are\"><\/span>Challenges implementing digital transformation in the future are:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Organizational_silos\"><\/span>Organizational silos<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As digital transformation (DT) increasingly becomes a corporate priority, it is essential to understand the potential obstacles in its path. One such obstacle is organizational silos. Organizational silos negatively impact digital transformation and pose obstacles in almost every aspect of change, from strategy building to implementation. The adverse effects of silos have been well documented; they can lead to decreased productivity, misaligned goals, and duplicate efforts, to name a few.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In large organizations, transformation can be complex. Employees are used to working a certain way and may resist change. Additionally, different departments or units within an organization (referred to as silos) can have difficulty collaborating. These silos can negatively impact digital transformation and pose obstacles in almost every aspect of change, from strategy building to implementation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many organizations have found themselves struggling with the challenge of creating and maintaining cohesive organizational silos. This disconnection leads to decision-making based on isolated problems and goals rather than on a holistic view of the company. With digital transformation, the business can build a comprehensive and cohesive approach to collaborate across departments worldwide.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Legacy_systems\"><\/span><b>Legacy systems<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/blog\/the-complete-guide-to-enterprise-mobility-solutions.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b>Enterprises<\/b><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> use legacy systems despite the availability of more agile and robust platforms. Many companies are hesitant to make the switch to newer technologies, especially when it comes to their core systems. Legacy systems can be challenging to modify and often require a significant investment of time and resources to upgrade.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Legacy systems are a top hindrance to digital transformation for many enterprises. Many companies are still using outdated software and technologies. This results in a lack of productivity and an inability to compete with other businesses. Legacy systems need to be updated to improve the company&#8217;s operations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There&#8217;s no question that older software can hold an organization back. Outdated applications are often slower and more inflexible, making it harder to respond to changes and integrate with new technologies. This can be a particular problem when an organization is undergoing digital transformation. Companies need to quickly adapt their systems and processes to take advantage of new opportunities to succeed.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Risk-averse_culture\"><\/span><b>Risk-averse culture<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A business culture that resists change impedes growth and development, and there is a risk-averse culture within many enterprises regarding digital transformation. Businesses need to adapt to changes in the marketplace to remain competitive, but this can be difficult when a corporate culture is resistant to change. Many companies are hesitant to embrace new technologies or ways of doing things because they fear change. Still, this resistance can end up being a hindrance to growth and development. By being open to change and embracing new technologies, businesses can stay ahead of the curve and remain competitive in today&#8217;s ever-changing marketplace.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Organizations must provide comprehensive onboarding training and continuous employee performance support to help employees become productive and proficient with a tool quickly.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Evolving_customer_needs\"><\/span>Evolving customer needs<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the pandemic is still going strong, it&#8217;s important to remember that customer needs have constantly evolved since the virus&#8217;s onset. For instance, some people may need to stay home to keep their families safe, while others may want to continue working despite the risks. It&#8217;s important to remember that everyone&#8217;s needs are different and that businesses should adapt accordingly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, digital transformation is not an easy project, and intensive transformation efforts can take years to accomplish. Successful transformations must consider the unique needs of each business, the regulatory environment, and the available technology.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Henceforth, enterprises must plan to be agile when it comes time to adopt new digital technologies. These changes can come from various sources, but most often, they are spurred on by the <\/span>rapid innovation<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of new technologies. An organization needs to be nimble enough to adopt these changes and keep up with the competition.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Absence_of_IT_skills\"><\/span>Absence of IT skills<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many enterprises are not able to accomplish their digital transformation goals because of a lack of technically-skilled employees. The average person does not have the skill set required for the high-demand, technical jobs necessary for a company to succeed in the digital age. Consequently, a skills gap exists in many organizations. A lack of technically-skilled employees can severely hinder a company&#8217;s ability to implement digital transformation successfully.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Successful transformation requires a skilled and high-performing IT team. You&#8217;ll need an experienced, high-performing IT team to complete your transformation efforts. This team should be able to adapt to changing conditions and support your business goals quickly. It is essential to have a solid plan in place to do this.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Security_challenges\"><\/span>Security challenges<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a business to successfully undergo digital transformation, it must leave behind on-premise solutions in favor of moving everything to the cloud and integrating all of its data into one centralized system. This can be a complicated process, but it is necessary to maintain consistency across all departments and to create a system that can be managed and monitored more effectively.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enterprises must pick a full-proof plan to mitigate any <\/span>cyber security<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> threat. Cyber attacks are on the rise, and companies need to be prepared. There are many ways to do this, but the best way is to have a plan in place.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Budget_Constraint\"><\/span>Budget Constraint<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Digital transformation is not a cheap investment. Switching to a new platform or system requires time, effort, and resources. The benefits of implementing a digital transformation program, however, are many. By investing in a digital transformation strategy, businesses can improve their bottom line, engage their customers more effectively, and increase employee productivity.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Lack_of_technical_resources\"><\/span>Lack of technical resources<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Businesses today are not only facing a talent shortage but also a shortage of other resources crucial to the adoption of digital initiatives. These include money, time, and patience. The talent shortage is the most pressing issue, as businesses cannot adopt digital initiatives without the talent to do so. The other deficits are also significant, as they can hamper the adoption of digital initiatives.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_to_overcome_Digital_Transformation_challenges\"><\/span>How to overcome Digital Transformation challenges?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With so many digital transformation challenges, it can be hard to keep up. Some factors are out of your control and can be overwhelming. However, you can overcome these challenges with the right tools and strategies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Below we have included a few steps to overcome the barriers.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Digital transformation<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> programs are designed to align an organization&#8217;s digital capabilities with its business outcomes. But too often, these initiatives are not well-aligned with the overall business strategy.

Many of the initiatives in the plan are too ambitious and require a significant pivot in how the company does business. This will require a cultural reset and a commitment from all levels of the organization to change.<\/span><\/span>&nbsp;<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keep feedback loops open so that everyone is kept abreast of developments.

The roadmap should be aligned with the company&#8217;s business goals and objectives.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Experience_successful_Digital_Transformation_with_Hidden_Brains\"><\/span>Experience successful Digital Transformation with Gozoom Technologies<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Undeniably, cutting-edge technology is critical for a business to succeed.
