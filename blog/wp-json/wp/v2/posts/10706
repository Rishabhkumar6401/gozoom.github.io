An entrepreneur who has an idea for a product should start by building a minimum viable product, which is a limited but working, version of a product that is likely to be successful. This allows the entrepreneur to test their product and gather (and, in some cases, leverage) feedback from their early users and customers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One way to generate app ideas is to make an app that changes your life and solves a problem. Or, combine your app idea with a physical product to create something new. The possibilities are endless.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You need to think about the business model of your app sooner than later, or else your idea will evolve into something no one would want. This early thinking can be crucial to the success of your app in the long-run, so spend some time on it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a startup founder, you must think about many things. How is your product going to be used? Who is the target user? Who will be your competitors?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The hardest part isn\u2019t coming up with a new idea.
