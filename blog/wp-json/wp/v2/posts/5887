Since the last few years, DevOps is now going mainstream and its popularity increasing at a phenomenal level shaping a whole new business world and growth.<\/p>\n<p>DevOps principles of agility and continuous delivery support enterprises to deal with business realities such as increasing speed and complexity. DevOps provides critical support to both customer and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/blog\/choosing-the-best-framework-for-enterprise-application-development.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">enterprise level applications<\/a> empowering digital transformation. For instance, customer-based applications require changes based on feedback in a quick timeframe. On the other hand, enterprise applications require high performance and automated development and deployment approaches to keep pace rapidly changing market realities.<\/p>\n<p>Many companies are adopting enterprise versions to ensure access to own infrastructure and security is in the best hands possible. DevOps helps businesses strike a balance between speed and quality. Speed is great until quality starts to suffer, and quality is only worthwhile if you can reach the customer in a reasonable timeframe. To get advantage of both worlds, it is important to automate software engineering, partner with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/devops-solutions.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>DevOps solutions and services company<\/strong><\/a>, as well as measure and evaluate key metrics.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Benefits_of_DevOps\"><\/span>Benefits of DevOps<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>In a DevOps-driven environment, the entire team is accountable for delivering both advance features and stability. The combination of a shared code base, continuous integration, test-driven techniques and automated deploys, among other things, exposes problems\u2014in application code, infrastructure, or configuration\u2014earlier in the process.<\/p>\n<p>Problems are likely to be less complex because change sets are relatively small. DevOps engineers can explore and gain advantage of real-time data into the performance of their systems to quickly understand the impact of application changes. And resolution times are relatively fast because team members don\u2019t have to wait for different teams to troubleshoot and solve the problem identified.<\/p>\n<p>Whether it is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/logistics.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Logistics IT solutions company<\/strong><\/a> or healthcare company, organizations that incorporate DevOps practices achieve results, it is plain and to the point. With a single team composed of cross-functional members all working in tandem and collaboration, DevOps organizations can deliver with maximum speed, functionality, and innovation.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Continuity in software delivery<\/li>\n<li>Less complexity to manage<\/li>\n<li>Quick resolutions of problems<\/li>\n<li>Highly productive teams<\/li>\n<li>Employee engagement<\/li>\n<li>Development opportunities<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>And there are business benefits:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Faster delivery of features<\/li>\n<li>More stable operating environments<\/li>\n<li>Improved communication and collaboration<\/li>\n<li>More time to innovate (rather than fix\/maintain)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Faster Development Results in Faster Execution<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/blog\/how-to-implement-devops.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DevOps implementation<\/a> can radically transform business operations, improving business efficiency, collaboration, and customer experiences. With the unified strength of the development and operations team, applications are executed at a fast pace compared to work done by a separate teams.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Fewer Deployment Errors and Quick Recovery<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>DevOps ensures shorter development cycles as the voluminous levels of codes can be executed in a relatively shorter duration of time and the bugs in the codes are detected easily. With shorter development cycles in DevOps and combined teamwork, codes can be executed within a small amount of time and recovery is quick.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Improved Communication and Collaboration<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>DevOps encourages a thriving work culture and enhances productivity. Due to increasing trust level between teams, DevOps encourages teams to innovate and join hands together. Also, the operations team does not have to wait for the other team to find and fixed bugs, as in DevOps, all teams work together. This process becomes continuous as all employees work towards an end goal resulting in faster product delivery.<\/p>\n<p>In DevOps, because of the combined work culture, executives become happier and even more productive. When members from both teams trust each other, they can innovate better and work with full force.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Increased Productivities<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In DevOps completely identical environment is used for development, testing, operations, and deployment. As DevOps is a continuous cycle, the development process is fast enough, and the chances of going wrong are relatively very less. The ongoing processes of development, testing and operations start resulting in increased productivity. Due to cloud-based platforms also the testing and operations in DevOps increases.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Reduced Costs<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The continuous lifecycle of DevOps integrates totally different processes leading to one integrated process wherever different groups work along to develop one software product therefore continuous integration ends up in less number of team members and reduced IT prices.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"SecOps_New_Era_of_DevOps\"><\/span>SecOps: New Era of DevOps<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>DevOps is seamless amalgamation of both development and operations to form a collaborative or shared approach for the tasks performed by a company&#8217;s application development and IT operations teams. SecOps is the collaboration between security and operations teams, setting forth best practices for organizations to follow, processes to adhere, tools to use to ensure the security of application environment.<\/p>\n<p>SecOps allows enterprises to handle analysis of security threats, incident management, optimizing the effectiveness of security controls, reduced security risks and increased business security. SecOps is all about ensuring that organizations do not sacrifice security measures to attain set performance and uptime metrics.<br \/>\nSimilarly as security is everybody&#8217;s duty \u2014 and not simply the individuals who work in SecOps. As noted, DevOps is a way to deal with continuous improvement. Everybody should be ready; particularly C-suite administrators who would decide the DevOps approach.<\/p>\n<p>Objectives of a fruitful SecOps approach revolves around presenting security perspectives prior or at each phase of the advancement cycle. Critical decision making is needed from the upper administration to focus on making security upgrades, so as to for a holistic roadmap. Goals can likewise incorporate cross-functional coordinated effort and cross-utilitarian audit of operational dangers.<\/p>\n<p>SecOps might be a social change for certain associations that requires bigger issues to be tended to before objectives can be accomplished. In this circumstance, goals may incorporate categorizing work jobs and needs, identifying business dangers related with security occurrences and concurring on center business capacities.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Finally<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Both DevOps and SecOps have unique frameworks and accountabilities. However, this doesn\u2019t mean that DevOps and SecOps are all about functioning in different silos. DevOps and SecOps either succeed in increasing speed, agility and security or both fail.<\/p>\n<div id=\"ez-toc-container\" class=\"ez-toc-v2_0_47_1 ez-toc-wrap-left counter-hierarchy ez-toc-counter ez-toc-transparent ez-toc-container-direction\">\n<div class=\"ez-toc-title-container\">\n<p class=\"ez-toc-title\">Table of Contents<\/p>\n<span class=\"ez-toc-title-toggle\"><\/span><\/div>\n<nav><ul class='ez-toc-list ez-toc-list-level-1 ' ><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/blog\/how-devops-is-driving-business-growth.html\/#Benefits_of_DevOps\" title=\"Benefits of DevOps\">Benefits of DevOps<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-2\" href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/blog\/how-devops-is-driving-business-growth.html\/#SecOps_New_Era_of_DevOps\" title=\"SecOps: New Era of DevOps\">SecOps: New Era of DevOps<\/a><\/li><\/ul><\/nav><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp; DevOps has transcended the stage of being just a buzzword or business growth.
