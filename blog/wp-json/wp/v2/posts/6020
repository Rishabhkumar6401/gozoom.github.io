The breakout success of Pok\u00e9mon Go in 2016, and innovative ad formats popularized by Snapchat have piqued the interest of consumers and brands alike. Now, marketers in a variety of industries are experimenting with new applications of AR.<\/p>\n<p>AR advertising is expected to change phenomenally the way brands will interact with audiences. Brands that want to make their AR experiences grow will need to use AR to meet their audiences\u2019 specific needs for information, accessibility and entertainment.<\/p>\n<p>Social media companies\u2014including Snapchat and Facebook are exploring to provide innovative offerings and measurement models which are relatively easy to experiment with and easing AR adoption among both brands and consumers.<\/p>\n<p>AR videos will be able to further engage their audiences. There are different ways these videos can transform retail experiences, such as to give customers product demos or help people visualize what it would be like if they bought the service.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6024\" src=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/AR-in-Advertising.png\" alt=\"AR in Advertising \" width=\"470\" height=\"449\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/AR-in-Advertising.png 470w, https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/AR-in-Advertising-300x287.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"AR_in_Retail\"><\/span>AR in Retail<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The retail evolution will continue to challenge brick-and-mortar and the traditional retail, but it will be offset by the expanding retail footprint and other niche retailers will be well positioned to thrive in this environment.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe year 2019 will show another strong year for the sector, with total retail sales expected to grow 3.3% to $5.529 trillion and ecommerce sales expected to grow 15.1% to $605.3 billion.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Augmented reality holds tremendous value and potential for the retail industry, because of its wide availability and accessibility on shoppers\u2019 smartphones<\/p>\n<p>The estimated AR users in the US will grow 14.9% to 58.8 million in 2019. There are 20+ million users who began using AR between 2016 and 2018 and getting accustomed to its use in everyday life. AR is considered a highly immersive technology that will help bridge the digital and physical divide at retail.<\/p>\n<p>The technology is widely used to delight customers by allowing several activities such as visualization of clothes and makeup on oneself or understanding the look of furniture inside one\u2019s home. However, the widest application of AR is to provide realistic product information, which works across any retail category, as well as adding a textual and visual information layer to products in the store. This will help quickly get vital information such as quick view of product, user ratings, reviews, features and dimensions, bringing utility to shoppers, anytime they need from anywhere.<\/p>\n<p>Easy accessibility of this technology will increase its adoption. Brands are starting to leverage this technology more and more. The days when most consumers will try out products using their cameras via their social media account does not seem to be far away.<\/p>\n<h4 style=\"font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 42px; color: #0a57f4;\">Conclusion<\/h4>\n<p>AR hardware and applications arguably have more uses in transforming the real world, which will initially be used for gaming or entertainment. However, this technology is disrupting numerous industries and has innumerable applications for businesses. It will be interesting to see AR technology evolve and how businesses will continue to integrate this technology.<\/p>\n<div id=\"ez-toc-container\" class=\"ez-toc-v2_0_47_1 ez-toc-wrap-left counter-hierarchy ez-toc-counter ez-toc-transparent ez-toc-container-direction\">\n<div class=\"ez-toc-title-container\">\n<p class=\"ez-toc-title\">Table of Contents<\/p>\n<span class=\"ez-toc-title-toggle\"><\/span><\/div>\n<nav><ul class='ez-toc-list ez-toc-list-level-1 ' ><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/blog\/importance-of-augmented-reality-app-development-for-different-industries.html\/#Healthcare\" title=\"Healthcare\">Healthcare<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-2\" href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/blog\/importance-of-augmented-reality-app-development-for-different-industries.html\/#AR_in_Advertising\" title=\"AR in Advertising\">AR in Advertising<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-3\" href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/blog\/importance-of-augmented-reality-app-development-for-different-industries.html\/#AR_in_Retail\" title=\"AR in Retail\">AR in Retail<\/a><\/li><\/ul><\/nav><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>For several years, Augmented reality (AR) has been dubbed as a technology bringing about transformational change in the way people live and work.
