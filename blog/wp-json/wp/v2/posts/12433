To gain entry, visitors swipe their card readers at the entrance gate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The system improves access control and security by only letting authorized people into the building. Using a card reader access control system, it&#8217;s also possible to monitor the number of people that enter and leave, which helps detect security breaches.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Biometric_Access_Control\"><\/span><b>Biometric Access Control<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using a biometric access control system, you can determine whether to let someone inside or not based on their unique biometric information.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An authorized user&#8217;s biometric characteristics like face, fingerprint, fingerprint, iris, and palm are compared to those stored in the biometric template database.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Vehicle_Access_Control_%E2%80%93_License_plate_recognition\"><\/span><b>Vehicle Access Control<\/b><b> &#8211; License plate recognition<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vehicle access control systems offer a greater level of security than intercoms. The biggest concerns are their intercom system and license plate reader (LPR).&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This gate access control system reads the license plates of all vehicles passing through the gate. In addition to allowing licenses of trusted friends and family members, the resident may also require access to these vehicles to be granted each time they enter or make it so they are notified every time a vehicle enters.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ideally suited to large, gated communities that see a lot of traffic from vehicles instead of people.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Video_Intercom_Systems\"><\/span><b>Video Intercom Systems<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A video intercom system is the next most effective type of gated access system.

Here are wide range of benefits gated community access control system solutions bring to the table:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-12428 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Benefits-of-Gated-Community-System.webp\" alt=\"Benefits of Gated Community System\" width=\"908\" height=\"1296\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Benefits-of-Gated-Community-System.webp 908w, https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Benefits-of-Gated-Community-System-210x300.webp 210w, https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Benefits-of-Gated-Community-System-717x1024.webp 717w, https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Benefits-of-Gated-Community-System-768x1096.webp 768w, https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Benefits-of-Gated-Community-System-150x214.webp 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 908px) 100vw, 908px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"An_Increase_in_Privacy\"><\/span><b>An <\/b><b>Increase in Privacy<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the vital benefits of living in a guard-gated community with advanced gated access control system software in place is that you will enjoy greater privacy. It is possible to limit access to the home through controlled access points, usually an electric gate, which prevents uninvited guests and non-locals from entering the house. Furthermore, the homeowners can also control who enters their property and who exits it.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Round-the-Clock_Security\"><\/span><b>Round-the-Clock Security<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An access control system installed in your gate can enhance security, particularly during off-peak hours, regardless of whether you have a security official at the gate. Security teams can monitor and control gate access remotely by utilizing features such as schedules and alerts.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Only_Allow_Authorized_Individuals_Access\"><\/span><b>Only Allow Authorized Individuals Access<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>The biggest advantage of installing an entry gate access control system is that only those who are authorized will have access to your property. An active credential is required to unlock the gate, and certain gate access controls, such as an entry schedule and user permissions, further restrict gate access.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Reduces_Traffic_Disruptions\"><\/span><b>Reduces Traffic Disruptions<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For tenants entering or leaving the gated community, sitting in traffic for a long time is the last thing they want. An access control system that lacks an effective process could take up to five minutes to verify each vehicle and visitor before allowing them into the gated community. With effective access control, tenants and visitors can enter their homes immediately. By doing so, the traffic flow around the gate is streamlined, and no line of cars will be waiting to enter the gate.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Fewer_Guards_Required\"><\/span><b>Fewer Guards Required<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An access control system for a gate is essential to note because it does not simply deal with the credentials of vehicles but also controls unauthorized access. There&#8217;s less need for security guards with these systems. As part of the verification process, the guards must stay at a central control center, ready to respond to any issues or problems.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two guards must be on duty at each gate to verify the vehicles. Fortunately, there are now electronic verification tokens or cards. It saves you money by saving you from paying so many security salaries.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Improved_Monitoring\"><\/span><b>Improved Monitoring<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using a gated community access control system reduces the chance of error, which benefits residents. A manual-handling system is inherently prone to errors and negligence. With the latest technology, monitoring is precise and consistent, with little or no room for errors.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Bring_an_End_to_the_Traditional_Keys\"><\/span><b>Bring an <\/b><b>End to the Traditional Keys<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a lot of complications and drawbacks to using traditional keys. Access to certain areas can be restricted with individual keys. A bigger building needs more locks. Taking care of a janitor or high-clearance worker means carrying a bulky key ring and needing clarification about what each key does. With an access control system, people can access restricted areas more quickly, and you don&#8217;t need to call the locksmith as often.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Duplicate keys put you at risk of unauthorized access, and it won&#8217;t be a problem with the Gated access control system.

A unified system saves time, reduces costs, and makes it easier for everyone.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"A_cloud-based_Access_Management_System\"><\/span><b>A cloud-based Access Management System<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To reduce maintenance costs and overhead, ensure the gate system you choose is compatible with other access control systems in your building.

Furthermore, its convenient location enables easy access to many amenities.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"hbblog-cta\" style=\"background: #fdfdfd!important; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 30px; padding: 35px 25px 35px 25px; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #dfdfdf; border-radius: 5px; border-bottom-color: #f5bd00; border-bottom-width: 3px!important;\">\n<div class=\"hbblog-cta\">\n<h6 style=\"font-weight: 600; font-size: 24px!important; color: #212121; font-family: 'Open Sans',sans-serif; line-height: 36px;\">Are you ready to experience the benefits of an access control system?<\/h6>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"hbblog-cta-btn\" style=\"margin-top: 20px!important;\"><a style=\"background: #282f6f; color: #fff; font-size: 18px; font-weight: 500; padding: 10px 20px; border-radius: 3px;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/inquiry.html\">Contact Us<\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_to_secure_your_Gated_Premises\"><\/span><b>How to secure your Gated Premises?<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gated communities with top-notch security protocols are more valuable than ungated communities. It is important to note that a gated community&#8217;s security depends upon several factors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Security improvements shouldn&#8217;t impact the gated community&#8217;s exclusive amenities, privacy, or property value. With the security improvements, you will be able to increase the level of engagement within your community in due course.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To enhance security and safety, gated communities&#8217; residents may wish to consider the following:<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Modernize_your_surveillance_system\"><\/span><b>Modernize your surveillance system<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Install a modern surveillance system that is capable of withstanding external attacks for the sake of collective protection. However, a gated community must go beyond simply installing a surveillance system for security purposes.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Locks_that_use_advanced_technology\"><\/span><b>Locks that use advanced technology<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rental apartments usually have older locks that can be replaced with a more modern model. Gated communities require high-end locks that include an advanced locking system. The system helps keep gated communities protected from break-ins and sabotage.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Keep_an_eye_on_the_perimeter\"><\/span><b>Keep an eye on the perimeter<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The security guards should also conduct regular perimeter checks in your community. A gated community needs to do regular perimeter checks to determine the potential security risks within the community and to evaluate them.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A perimeter inspection provides security teams with insights into vulnerabilities and allows them to make appropriate physical adjustments to prevent unauthorized entry.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Conclusion\"><\/span><b>Conclusion<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Homeowners are increasingly looking for gated communities to protect their property&#8217;s privacy and security.
