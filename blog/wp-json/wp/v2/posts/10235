If you\u2019re coming from an Angular 1 background, it should be easy to transition your development workflow from HTML templates to developing within components.<\/p>\n<p>The most significant change with Angular 2+ is that many features are now out of scope for Angular, which means you\u2019ll need to pick up other libraries to add capabilities like routing and templating. This also leads to one of my favorite aspects of Angular 2+, which is that componentization allows for greater reusability and faster development.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Why_use_Angular\"><\/span>Why use Angular<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Angular offers a variety of benefits, but before we get into that, let\u2019s take a quick look at what it is. Angular is an open-source web framework used to create single-page applications (SPA). By utilizing JavaScript in tandem with HTML and CSS, you can create well-crafted and responsive apps with less development overhead.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, Google found that teams who develop SPAs using Angular can complete projects faster than those using other frameworks. That said, there are a lot of moving parts when building an app with angular so you\u2019ll need to have a thorough understanding of how these tools work together to achieve optimal results.<\/p>\n<p>Those new to angular might find it difficult to choose which services or third-party solutions best suit their needs\u2014not all are created equal.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Advantages_of_using_Angular_web_development_company\"><\/span>Advantages of using Angular web development company<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Angular has many advantages and they make your web application not only good but great. Angular web development companies have created best applications using Angular JS like \u2013 Trello, Google AdSense, Chartbeat and Evernote are just a few to name.<\/p>\n<p>Here is a list of reasons why you should consider Angular development for your project Write a professional blog post based off the following description:<\/p>\n<p>Angular web development companies are experienced in building web applications. They can customize it as per your requirements and make sure that your product is ready to face challenges of current markets.<\/p>\n<p>Angular-based application is usually faster, easier to maintain, and cost-effective because JavaScript uses less bandwidth than most other popular programming languages, you will spend less time worrying about performance and more time working on adding new features to keep your customers happy!<\/p>\n<p>Besides, you get a lot of support from Google as they offer several tools like angular template compiler which helps a lot with compressing code size. The server-side rendering support is another plus point for Angular developers when compared to other front-end frameworks since it supports search engine crawlers easily.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Top_benefits_of_using_Angular\"><\/span>Top benefits of using Angular<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Once you go with Angular, your web app is going to be both dynamic and powerful. This is mainly because it works well with existing code. It\u2019s not an off-the-shelf framework, meaning that as long as your code compiles and runs, it should work great with Angular.<\/p>\n<p>And don\u2019t worry about a steep learning curve; there\u2019s a lot of documentation available for those new to building in JavaScript or simply picking up Angular for the first time.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Disadvantages_of_using_Angular\"><\/span>Disadvantages of using Angular<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>As with any new technology, there are some potential drawbacks to using Angular. Some of these include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Complexity:<\/strong> Moving to new technology can be difficult, especially when working with a team. There&#8217;s a learning curve and you may encounter bugs that need to be ironed out before moving forward.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Performance problems:<\/strong> While static page load times for websites built with AngularJS don&#8217;t tend to suffer as much as dynamic ones, performance is still an issue that needs addressing. As more features are added (such as video embeds) page loading times will increase\u2014especially on mobile devices like smartphones and tablets.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_to_get_started_Partner_with_a_top_Angular_web_development_company\"><\/span>How to get started?&nbsp;Partner with a top Angular web development company<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Thanks to its responsive, reactive design and myriad features, Angular is quickly becoming one of if not The most popular front-end web development frameworks.
