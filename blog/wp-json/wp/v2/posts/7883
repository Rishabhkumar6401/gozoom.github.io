With the era of omnichannel eCommerce, voice-based smart devices are playing a critical role in facilitating contactless payment with speed and convenience.<\/p>\n<p>Contactless payments can be made through different modes (credit, debit cards, net banking, UPI, wallets).

Some of the fast-growing and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/blog\/eye-catching-ecommerce-design-trends-for-2020.html\">popular eCommerce web design trends<\/a> are as follows-<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Asymmetrical_layouts\"><\/span>Asymmetrical layouts<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Well, asymmetry is a little risky to work with while designing the layout of your website. Even with the slightest error, the layout can look untidy, but if done correctly, you will have a website with an ultra-modern look.<br \/>\nHere are some tips to deem while working with the asymmetrical layout.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Get rid of the spacing within the grid layout of the interface so that you can enjoy more freedom.<\/li>\n<li>Try to overlap elements and add contrast to large headers with some smaller images.<\/li>\n<li>Utilize the empty background space correctly<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Interactive_design\"><\/span>Interactive design<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>In today\u2019s world, a simple and plain layout is not going to take your sales to the next level. You have to opt for interactive designs to interact with your customers and create a positive user experience. The designs will improve your brand image and elevate your growth rate. You can add an interactive video, explain the benefits of the product with a 3D image, and take benefit from micro-interactions.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Dark_Mode\"><\/span>Dark Mode<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>The dark mode is another trending design trend that works quite well with the OLED screens that are particularly found in smartphones. As mobile commerce is on the boom, the trend will be quite beneficial in the long run as it helps you deliver an eye-friendly and eye-catching design for your brand. With this design, you can easily highlight the important elements on your website and get a creative edge over your competitors.<br \/>\nMinimalism<\/p>\n<p>Less is more. Yes, you heard it correctly. The minimalistic design not only allows your customers to find their desired products easily but also helps the website to load quickly. Most of the users don\u2019t have the patience to wait for the website to load properly, so this design layout is the best choice to opt for. Besides this, it is suitable for small business owners to attract more traffic without adding more stress to their budget.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Use_of_bold_color\"><\/span>Use of bold color<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>The key to having a large customer base is by attracting them to your website. Hence, most websites have forgone their initial theme and color scheme and gone for a bold and highly contrasting color scheme. The paradigmatic shift from pale and neutral colors to warm and bold ones is apparent through the websites. Such a color scheme has gained huge popularity that is likely to increase in the future.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Lower_Website_Load_Time_and_Page_Speed\"><\/span>Lower Website Load Time and Page Speed<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>All e-commerce websites are committed to increasing customer satisfaction by implementing different innovative strategies. However, lower load time and page speed are one of the most essential web design trends likely to revolutionize 2022. Higher load times generally affect page results and SEO and therefore companies have increasingly focused on reducing that. The customers are taken to a new page and new results are generated in the blink of your eye and there\u2019s no waiting anymore!<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Increased_Use_of_Smart_Content\"><\/span>Increased Use of Smart Content<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Websites have witnessed a rapid increase in the use of smart content. Smart contents are accompanied by engaging graphics, signs, statistics, and much more. They are directed towards generating maximum customer engagement. Smart content also helps in attracting a more significant number of customers to e-commerce websites. Thus, such websites have gained considerable benefit from the use of smart content. Most web development companies have made it a point to include smart content under their web design template to avoid missing out on this essential feature.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Personalized_filters_and_content\"><\/span>Personalized filters and content<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Most websites have begun to display personalized content based on your location and purchase trends. The use of big data has made such innovation possible and within the grasp of most e-commerce companies. These websites use your geo-location and map your tastes and preferences to display products accordingly. Such a feature helps in increasing customer satisfaction and reduces their effort in searching for products of their choice. Instead, what they want is directly placed in front of them with the help of personalized content. You can also filter your choice through several options in the e-commerce sites. These filters let you select products of a specific range, material, and much more.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Payment_diversification\"><\/span>Payment diversification<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Payment diversification is one of the most significant and remarkable web designing trends in the current times. With the help of payment diversification options, e-commerce platforms are now better equipped to accept payments from different sources and gateways. Thus, customers need not depend on credit and debit cards for their purchases anymore. Instead, they can use more diverse payment options that include UPI payments, net banking, and so on. This feature has helped in enhancing customer satisfaction and offered considerable flexibility in online purchases.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Here_are_top_eCommerce_Platforms_to_Launch_for_Your_Website_in_2022\"><\/span><a id=\"ecommerce-platforms\"><\/a>Here are top eCommerce&nbsp;Platforms to Launch for Your Website in 2022<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<h3 style=\"color: #000; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 40px;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Shopify\"><\/span>Shopify<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>One of the most widely used eCommerce platforms, Shopify is growing in terms of popularity, making it one of the most comprehensive platforms around.

Magento&#8217;s administration interface provides the option to tailor your site based on business requirements. Scalable and backed by a vast support network, Magento is the ultimate platform with search engine optimization, catalog management, and marketing tools that give merchants the ability to create sites that provide an unrivaled shopping experience for their customers.<\/p>\n<p>Magento is open-source and can be downloaded and installed on its own servers. It comes with additional plans that offer hosted cloud versions.<\/p>\n<p>However, it is a fairly advanced matter that is almost impossible to set up without technical knowledge.

It is straightforward to use with the ability to build a website of almost any complexity or magnitude. While closest to free, anyone can build a website on WordPress. However, making an eCommerce store is difficult. With the right plugin based on your requirements, this changes completely. And that&#8217;s where WooCommerce comes into play.<\/p>\n<p>An exponentially popular plugin, WooCommerce gives you almost every feature you could need from an e-commerce store. For regular WordPress users, WooCommerce will be as easy to operate. Furthermore, it is effortless to build and design. Taking just a few minutes for installation, it has a wide range of features for the community. The setup wizard provides stores&#8217; basic configuration and the room to explore.<\/p>\n<p>The plugin is free for WordPress sites. However, there are few moderately-priced extensions, but the core product costs nothing. The extensions are easy to use and enable as a regular WordPress plugin.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"color: #000; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 40px;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"BigCommerce\"><\/span>BigCommerce<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>BigCommerce is a robust eCommerce software containing a complete suite of features to build an online store. However, don&#8217;t just mistake it for a website builder. This eCommerce platform offers tools to streamline online business, allowing you to focus on what you do best. It has excellent features such as handling orders, products, and customers and in-built CRM, with different marketing tools, analytics dashboards, and free themes.<\/p>\n<p>Construction and design might give a difficult time to non-tech savvy. But they have seamless 24\/7 customer support.<\/p>\n<p>Just on the lines of WooCommerce, BigCommerce provides its own tour\/tutor system introducing several useful features, which we highly recommend.<\/p>\n<ul style=\"margin-left: 30px;\">\n<li><strong>Manage orders and inventory<\/strong><br \/>\nPowerful control panel to completely process and fulfill orders end to end from a single location.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Accept payments from leading providers.<\/strong><br \/>\nBigCommerce doesn&#8217;t put any additional rates or costs for using your preferred payment gateway.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Marketing features<\/strong><br \/>\nAn eCommerce website is search engine optimization friendly aimed to increase organic traffic.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Optimized for conversion<\/strong><br \/>\nDrive traffic and empower to get more sales out of the traffic.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It comes with a free 15-day trial. However, BigCommerce is a paid-only platform with three different plans; the most economical plans start with a very reasonable $29.95 monthly. Against the price, you get unlimited -products, storage, as well as bandwidth.<\/p>\n<p>The only flipside is this plan is at a 1.5% per-order transaction fee. If you don&#8217;t pay the payment, you&#8217;ll need to upgrade to a $79.95 plan and their most expensive plan will cost $249.95.<\/p>\n<p>You can also decide to buy custom themes, typically ranging from $125 to 250.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Here_are_2022_trends_in_eCommerce_Industries\"><\/span><a id=\"ecommerce-industries-trends\"><\/a>Here are 2022 trends in eCommerce Industries:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<h3 style=\"color: #000; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 40px;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Product-Market_Fit_Varies_by_Region_and_Country\"><\/span>Product-Market Fit Varies by Region and Country<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>It is essential to understand geography to make strategic decisions on the product market.

However, local differences in payment methods, language, and currency matter.<\/p>\n<h4 style=\"font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 42px; color: #0a57f4;\">Conclusion:<\/h4>\n<p>The Ecommerce industry is at the cusp of change and consistently evolving. ECommerce companies need to stay updated with the latest trends. While these trends are just a few, there are emerging trends creating a buzz in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/e-commerce.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">eCommerce industry<\/a> such as drones, facial recognition in stores, AI in customer sourcing and more. In such scenarios, it is important to understand your business needs and target audience.<\/p>\n<p>While the ability to innovate will help stand tall in a highly competitive industry, Merely copying a
