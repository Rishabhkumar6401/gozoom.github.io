Over the years, mobile apps have evolved, with each year introducing new trends and changes.<\/p>\n<p>During 2020 and 2021 many technological advancements influenced the mobile development landscape, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) technology, Artificial Intelligence (AI), cloud-native apps, virtual and augmented reality, 5G connectivity, and much more.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Below_are_the_mobile_app_development_trends_that_will_be_on_demand\"><\/span>Below are the mobile app development trends that will be on demand<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Artificial Intelligence: Chatbots and Voice Assistants<\/strong><br \/>\nArtificial intelligence is one of the most popular application development trends in the current times as it helps in a proper assessment of the surroundings and the nitty-gritty of business environments without human interference. It has helped customers increase their satisfaction levels by immediate chatbot responses, voice assistants, and much more. Thus, artificial intelligence has reduced the chances of human errors.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Instant Apps<\/strong><br \/>\nInstant apps help users to access their content without installing them on their devices. This ensures greater flexibility and user-friendliness as the users need not install them. As a result, instant apps are often preferred by individuals as they help them save a lot of their device\u2019s memory.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Hybrid mobile app development frameworks<\/strong><br \/>\nMost application development trends depend upon a hybrid app development framework. As the name suggests a hybrid app development framework is a combination of the native and the new app development framework, that is mainly used for developing applications for more than one platform. Such applications require a cross-network platform.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Blockchain and decentralized apps<\/strong><br \/>\nWhile blockchain has introduced considerable automation, decentralized applications have helped in ensuring greater user autonomy. Such applications are also preferred over others as they are highly efficient in open network platforms and perform better than the rest. This is because a decentralized application seldom has a single or central error point. Thus, an error does not prevent the functioning of the entire app and ensures better performance. Decentralized applications are also easy to edit as you need not change the parent coding and re-code them from the beginning.<\/li>\n<li><strong>IoT and connectivity Apps<\/strong><br \/>\nIoT has brought about remarkable changes in the technical world, especially in the sphere of application development. IoT has not only led to many automation but has also ensured better performing apps with no chance of human error as IoT has minimized the inclusion of human interference in their operations.<\/li>\n<li><strong>VUI (Voice User Interfaces) apps<\/strong><br \/>\nVUI apps use voice-recognition technology and ensure the users can get enough product descriptions and access different features effortlessly. VUI is hands-free and thus ensures greater customer satisfaction as they do not need to do much to search for a specific product or service. Such technologies have made e-commerce quite hassle-free.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Beacons Technology<\/strong><br \/>\nBeacons technology plays a key role in converting a visitor to a buyer by accessing the device\u2019s information and offering several discounts on the user\u2019s device. Such a mechanism has helped applications increase online traffic and generate leads. Beacons technology has in fact become one of the most popular application development trends in 2021 and is expected to rise even more in 2022.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Which_mobile_application_development_trends_do_you_feel_will_impact_work_or_have_a_bigger_influence_on_the_users\"><\/span>Which mobile application development trends do you feel will impact work or have a bigger influence on the users?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>When we first think about AI, virtual assistants like Siri or Alexa come to mind. However, the use cases go far and beyond this for app development.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em>Artificial intelligence and machine learning both penetrated mobile app development years ago. But we\u2019ve only just begun to scratch the surface with how these advanced technologies can be used<\/em>.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Last year, Apple released Core ML 3. This latest version of the iOS machine learning framework was built to help developers embed AI technology into their apps.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Examples_of_AI_features_that_can_be_implemented_into_a_mobile_app_include\"><\/span>Examples of AI features that can be implemented into a mobile app include:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Image recognition<\/li>\n<li>Face detection<\/li>\n<li>Text and image classification<\/li>\n<li>Sentiment recognition and classification<\/li>\n<li>Speech recognition<\/li>\n<li>Predictive maintenance<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Artificial intelligence can make apps smarter, and ultimately improve performance at every level.

Why?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<blockquote><p><em>Cross-platform mobile app development allows speeding up the development process and reducing costs.<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>These two main advantages make this area extremely popular, ensuring its continuous growth in recent years. Cross-platform development tools allow creating apps for multiple mobile platforms at once.<\/p>\n<p>When writing code, third-party programming languages are used, and in the end, the code is compiled into a native app for each OS.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"The_top_cross-platform_mobile_app_development_frameworks_include\"><\/span>The top cross-platform mobile app development frameworks include:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>React Native<\/li>\n<li>Flutter<\/li>\n<li>Xamarin<\/li>\n<li>NativeScript<\/li>\n<li>Ionic<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_do_you_think_mobile_app_development_has_changed_during_the_COVID-19_pandemic\"><\/span>How do you think mobile app development has changed during the COVID-19 pandemic?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The coronavirus pandemic has taken a toll on human lives, businesses, and livelihood.
