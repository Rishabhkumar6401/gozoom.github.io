A Logistics company may need to know how many vehicles are currently en route, in the state of maintenance, idle or out of order. To avoid delays, the company must be prepared to replace a broken vehicle or increase the number in case demand. The fleet information must be updated and adjusted as soon as possible.<\/li>\n<li>Personnel Information. While self-driving vehicles are still in the infancy stage, logistics companies rely on drivers to deliver goods.
