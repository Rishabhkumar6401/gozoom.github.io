Winning over it was a tough competition, however, with outstanding performance, Gozoom Technologies secured their position in the Finals leading with 88 runs. The much awaited ICL &#8211; III finals was held on 15th Feb&#8217;14, Saturday, at SGVP International School.<\/p>\n<p><i>First Half:<\/i><\/p>\n<p><b>Opponent won the toss and offered us batting<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Initially, it was not a good start with a loss of an early wicket of our main batsman (Venky) at a score of 10 \/1. However, we geared up with all our hopes on Anil Rao. Anil played consistently, but there was a big blow when Priyank was bowled over. After that, Manohar was on the field to make crucial partnership of 50 providing us a hope to be back in the game. Anil focused on playing it naturally meanwhile we lost one more wicket of Manohar.<\/p>\n<p>Bala Krishna went to bat for accelerating the score; he played four to five odd balls scoring at 100-strike rate. Anil concentrated on playing power shots. HB\u2019s captain Anirudh Sinh Gohil went to bat at 85\/4 scoring few runs. In the meanwhile, Anil reached his fifty giving a total score of 100 to the team. Further, with unexpected turn of events, Anil lost the game.<\/p>\n<p>Balu Mahesh went out to bat along with Arpit. Balu Mahesh got out at 108\/7 at 22.3, adding 5 to 8 runs. Next, it was the turn of Manish along with Arpit adding a little, but crucial 18 runs to the score. Our final total was 125\/7 after 25 overs.<\/p>\n<p><i>Second Half:<\/i><\/p>\n<p><b>Till now, whatever we decided we have executed it well<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Along with our Head Coach Ram Sir, we made the bowling and batting strategy, on the previous day of the Finals. We executed our plans well on the field.<\/p>\n<p>We stuck to the basics and let the opposition make the mistake because in order to win the game they need to score 125 runs. However, it was not going to be easy for them as our strength was both, bowling and fielding.<\/p>\n<p>We started well in bowling also and got the first wicket at 24 runs. Though, later their captain came to bat and started playing steadily. We have got the wicket so our plan was to put pressure on the opposition team.<\/p>\n<p>At the drinks we discussed to attack and take some quick wickets. Our plan was executed well as we took some quick wickets in next five overs. By then, they have already lost 6 wickets in 21 overs they require 38 runs in 24 balls.<\/p>\n<p>During the last over, 24 runs were required, we are just 1 wicket away from the victory. Manohar bowled the last over and took the wicket on the very first ball.<\/p>\n<p>The main reason for the victory in this tournament, we played as a team and trusted each other.<\/p>\n<p>There were many attendees at the closing ceremony from all the IT companies in Ahmedabad.
