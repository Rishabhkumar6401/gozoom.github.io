It is absolutely a fact, but with a grim side to it. You know your customers from your perspective, but to build an app, you need to know your products from the customers&#8217; perspective.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Find out more about your target audience, their problem, available solutions, what competitors are offering, and where you are lacking and gaining numbers.

It refers to the overall design and aesthetic of a product or system, including the colors, style, shapes, graphics, and other design elements used to convey information to users.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UX design decisions are often made in the design phase of an app development life cycle, and designers often rely on the information provided during this phase.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A UX designer can be faced with the challenge of making decisions that are best for the users of the digital experience while meeting the business goals of the product owner.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When your users interact with your app, you want them to enjoy their experience.
