This Google I\/O event is much more than mere Android P operating system announcements. It speaks about significant changes in Google Maps, Google Assistant and Gmail. Let\u2019s know what Google keynote speakers talked about in this conference and how could it add value to developers and user\u2019s world.<\/p>\n<p>In this blog, we shall discuss important updates and announcements revealed at Google I\/O 2018 and its impact in real world environment. You can also watch the <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/events.google.com\/io\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">live coverage of Google I\/O 2018<\/a><\/strong> technology breakthrough event and know about the innovations right as they are announced.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Google_IO_2018_News_Latest_Happenings\"><\/span>Google I\/O 2018 News &amp; Latest Happenings<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><strong>While there were a ton of announcements, these were the biggest highlights from the Google I\/O 2018 keynote:<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Google_Duplex\"><\/span>Google Duplex<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Google Assistant goes a step ahead in Artificial Intelligence to become capable of handling phone calls. It is now called as \u2018Google Duplex\u2019. With a natural-sounding and human-like voice, Google Duplex has the power to make phone call appointments and reservations for you. In fact, this AI powered Google Duplex can even handle few back-and-forth questions and answers when it makes a call for a specific purpose.<\/p>\n<p>The functionality of Google Duplex was demonstrated live at Google I\/O 2018 by making 2 phone calls: the first call was to book a haircut appointment and second one to make dinner table reservation at a restaurant. The assistant accomplished both the tasks successfully, that too in more humanly and surprising way.<\/p>\n<p>Google Duplex used common phrases and humanly tone to utter \u2018Mm-hmmm\u2019 to acknowledge that it is hearing to the person on other end. The assistant also used \u2018uhh\u2019 to give a feeling to opposite person that it is thinking on the question being asked.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Smart_Compose_Feature_of_Gmail\"><\/span>Smart Compose Feature of Gmail<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5069\" src=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Smart_compose.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Courtesy: Google<\/p>\n<p>Year 2018 is revolutionary for Gmail \u2013 it has experienced noticeably higher changes in its 14+ years of existence. At Google I\/O 2018, Gmail just got a smart makeover with new AI feature of \u2018smart compose\u2019. This predictive composition feature allows users to finish the sentences without the need to actually type it manually.<\/p>\n<p>This is a step higher than word suggestions that users get on phone as Gmail Smart Compose is not just suggesting words, but complete chunks of sentences while drafting an email. Now that Google has so much of users\u2019 data, its Machine Learning capabilities and predictive analysis is bound to be a lot smarter than mere autocorrect.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Google_Maps_Become_Much_More_User_Friendly\"><\/span>\nGoogle Maps Become Much More User Friendly<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>While Google Maps are among the favorites of users, Google I\/O 2018\u2019s announcement just made it friendlier to use. We currently use Google Maps to plot the fastest route to work and navigate through unknown places and unknown road. However, the blue dots can sometimes confuse the driver between \u2018slight left\u2019 to \u2018turn left\u2019.<\/p>\n<p>The company fixes this problem by integrating Google Lens into Google Maps. All you have to do is point the phone at the street. Upon doing this, StreetView AR overlay will pop up to point towards the right direction. At the same time, Google Maps layout is also present at the bottom of the screen. However, there were no announcements in Google I\/O 2018 related to when would this feature of Maps be available for use.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Android_P_Version_90\"><\/span>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/blog\/android-p-support-notch-displays.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Android P<\/a>: Version 9.0<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Google wants to make the Android P beta version more accessible. For the same reason, the beta version of this new operating system would be made available to following handsets:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Google Pixel<\/li>\n<li>Google Pixel XL<\/li>\n<li>Google Pixel 2<\/li>\n<li>Google Pixel 2 XL<\/li>\n<li>Essential Phone<\/li>\n<li>Nokia 7 Plus<\/li>\n<li>Xperia XZ2<\/li>\n<li>Xiaomi Mi Mix 2S<\/li>\n<li>Vivo X21<\/li>\n<li>Oppo R15 Pro<\/li>\n<li>OnePlus 6 (after its official launch)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Another updates on Android P disclosed at Google I\/O 2018 are as follows:<\/p>\n<p>Android P operating system would focus more on conserving battery life. Through adaptive battery concept, it would automatically predict apps that users would not use for the rest of the day and reduce its CPU wake up time.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adaptive brightness is coming to Android P that not only takes into account the environmental lighting conditions, but also considers your personal brightness preferences while setting the brightness.<\/li>\n<li>App Actions in Android P would predict the next action of user based on his current activity, time and circumstances.<\/li>\n<li>App Slices to allow developers place parts of their app into different portions of the OS.<\/li>\n<li>Android P is planning to make multitasking easier with new system navigation interface and horizontal bar to switch between apps of choice.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Such marvelous features of version 9.0 would enable <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/android-application-development.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Android app development company<\/a><\/strong> to build innovative apps.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Google_News\"><\/span>\nGoogle News<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Google News is getting refined as per the recent announcement at Google I\/O 2018. It would get a Flipboard similar to that of Apple News, which would make it simpler for users to access required information. All the news and information is bifurcated into sections of briefings and newscasts. Further, as per the update from Google I\/O 2018, this news would be surfaced from credible publications using Machine Learning capabilities. Google News would also allow users to subscribe to news sources they like.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Final Notes\u2026<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The announcements covered in this blog are just the most significant updates of Google I\/O 2018. To know about all the technology updates in depth, consider reviewing the live streaming or <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UC_x5XG1OV2P6uZZ5FSM9Ttw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">uploaded videos<\/a><\/strong>.
