Remember, this person will be the driving force to transform your idea into a fully functional scalable website. This person will create the online brand of your business that will allow you to connect with customers in the highly competitive virtual world.<\/p>\n<p>So, it\u2019s extremely important that you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/hire-php-developers.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hire best PHP developer<\/a>. It is also important to get it right the first time. There is no room for complacency; otherwise, you risk your business and money. It is not just about code or technology, it is about selecting a strategic partner who understands your business and shares the same passion for your business model.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"This_article_will_list_critical_pointers_that_will_help_you_identify_and_hire_the_Best_PHP_Developers_in_2022_for_your_project\"><\/span>This article will list critical pointers that will help you identify and hire the Best PHP Developers in 2022 for your project.<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<h3 style=\"color: #000; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 40px;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"1_Avoid_asking_stereotype_questions\"><\/span>1. Avoid asking stereotype questions<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>So, you are ready to interview a PHP programmer and you have got yourself a long list of questions ready. Well, that is the right approach definitely. Way to go, however, avoid asking stereotype questions. Sometimes we may feel obligated to ask the most obvious and generic questions to candidates. However, your focus should be on the practical utility of those questions. Will the answers to those questions help you assess the candidate\/s in real-time?<\/p>\n<p>Questions like what was PHP\u2019s release date or who rewrote the parser that formed PHP should be avoided. These are not the questions that will help you gauge the right PHP developer. You need to test knowledge about PHP rather than run a memory test. Avoid asking those questions which can be easily searched online. Rather, focus on asking practical questions that focus on real-world applications. Put forth examples and scenarios that you face during the time of the development process.<\/p>\n<p><b>Ask questions to test the technical prowess such as:<\/b><\/p>\n<ul style=\"margin-left: 30px;\">\n<li>How do you encrypt data using PHP?<\/li>\n<li>PHP design patterns?<\/li>\n<li>Describe your experiences with web services.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3 style=\"color: #000; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 40px;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"2_Past_Projects\"><\/span>2. Past Projects<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>While selecting a good offshore PHP development company or PHP developer, it is crucial that you check past projects. Ask for projects that are relevant to what you are looking for. Case studies and customer testimonials show that developers have worked with reputed companies and evaluated how good the company is. The reputation of a good offshore company will save you from hassles associated with quality and turnaround time. Also, interview and speak to the technical staff, project managers, or POCs who will be handling your work so that you are comfortable with their abilities.<\/p>\n<p>Case studies and customer testimonials show that developers have worked with reputed companies and evaluated how good the company is.

Knowledge Base<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Before you narrow down on the PHP developer, you need to evaluate the technical knowledge base. Assessing knowledge is the most fundamental thing to do before you hire any developer. This will be the vastest playground for you to play on. You can ask any number of questions you may wish to. Start from knowing about why they choose PHP over other programming languages and why do they <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/blog\/death-php-definitely-not-not-fall-trap.html\">think PHP<\/a> was the right choice for them.<\/p>\n<p>Once you get answers about them, move forward with the questions about how they think PHP benefits the clients and the companies. Next, get to know why according to them PHP does better compared to other languages. If they can positively compare and showcase the benefits of PHP when compared to other languages, you can assess that they have in-depth knowledge about programming languages and not just about one particular language.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;This is critical to ensure that PHP developers have the skills to deliver your project. You should also find out what type of training and ongoing classes <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/php-development.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PHP development company<\/a> offers its employees to stay updated with technology trends and expand their overall knowledge base. This aspect is very important. It helps you ensure that developers are up to date with all the technology advancements when building your PHP project.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"color: #000; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 40px;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"4_Check_Communication_Skills\"><\/span>4. Check Communication Skills<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Communication is the cornerstone of the strategy. The developer must be conversant with various modes such as audio, video, web, phone, and email messages. In some cases, communication between the developer and business owners over Skype or messaging apps turns out to be an effective alternative compared to lengthy emails.<\/p>\n<p>If you prefer to talk to a real person rather than type out lengthy emails, you need to choose a developer who is equally at ease in communicating over the phone. It is also important to know whether a PHP developer is comfortable in following instructions in English. Effective communication also means that your developer understands what he is doing. He will not only be communicating with internal teams but also with clients if the need arises.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your website developer has to be in touch with you continuously to ensure they meet your requirements. The top PHP developers have the best communication skills and ensure their clients are informed of every stage of website development. If the PHP developer is unwilling or nonchalant about communicating his ideas, it might result in a void between you both. Hence, it would be best to look for PHP developers with great communication skills. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"color: #000; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 40px;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"5_Attitude_Matters\"><\/span>5. Attitude Matters<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>While skillsets matter a lot, attitude can be a deal maker or a deal-breaker. Your focus should be on hiring best PHP developers who can adapt to changing situations easily and do not get frustrated too often. In order to assess this, ask questions that you think can put them into uncomfortable situations. Look how they respond and what they respond.<\/p>\n<p>The easiest way to find out whether someone will adapt to new scenarios by learning technologies is to find out by asking the following questions: Where do you learn new tips and tricks about PHP or Did you attend any technology event or seminar?<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"6_Ability_to_customize_your_website\"><\/span>6. Ability to customize your website<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Website customizations have grown as the most popular trend in website development. Is your PHP developer willing to implement all the customizations you need for your website? Remember, the top PHP developers would understand your needs and design your website accordingly. Hence, it would be best to ensure their ability and dedication towards your website development. This helps you choose the best PHP developer for your business. Such developers should always be willing to customize and change your website according to your tastes without reluctance.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"7_Assess_mutual_interests\"><\/span>7. Assess mutual interests<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Most website developers prefer using a vibrant color scheme to make your website more eye-catching and appealing. Make sure your PHP developer\u2019s tastes and preferences match yours. Are you fond of using pale colors while your developer is more into using pastel colors for developing websites? Such mismatches can affect your website development and change the way you want it to look. As a result, it is mandatory to know your tastes and preferences before hiring the best PHP developer.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"8_Gauge_skills_from_work_portfoliopast_projects\"><\/span>8. Gauge skills from work portfolio\/past projects<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>The previous projects completed by PHP web developers speak a lot about their experience and skills. For instance, a web developer may have sufficient skills in developing e-commerce websites but not in other kinds of business websites. It would be best if you selected the best PHP developer suited for your needs by understanding their previous work.<\/p>\n<p>The top PHP developers have a comprehensive account of their previous projects on their resumes or website. You must go through these to have a better understanding of their skills and knowledge.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Compare_the_prices\"><\/span>Compare the prices<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>The top PHP developers might charge slightly more than the rest because of their brand name, skills, and experience. However, are their charges excessively high? It would be best to check and compare the prices of various PHP developers before you choose the best one for your website. Make sure to weigh their prices according to their services, skills, and experience? Do you think they are charging more than the rest? In that case, it would be best to look for alternative options. Remember, website development is not just about hiring the best PHP developer. It is also about completing the project within a specific budget.<\/p>\n<h4 style=\"font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 42px; color: #0a57f4;\">Conclusion<\/h4>\n<p>Don\u2019t shy away from asking questions and clarifying points to avoid ambiguity. When you\u2019ve made up your mind to hire the best PHP developers, you should mention details in the contract and get it signed. Ensure to list the milestones detailing cost breakup to avoid confusion in the future. All the terms and conditions should be crystal clear.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div id=\"ez-toc-container\" class=\"ez-toc-v2_0_47_1 ez-toc-wrap-left counter-hierarchy ez-toc-counter ez-toc-transparent ez-toc-container-direction\">\n<div class=\"ez-toc-title-container\">\n<p class=\"ez-toc-title\">Table of Contents<\/p>\n<span class=\"ez-toc-title-toggle\"><\/span><\/div>\n<nav><ul class='ez-toc-list ez-toc-list-level-1 ' ><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/blog\/top-5-tips-for-hiring-best-php-developer.html\/#This_article_will_list_critical_pointers_that_will_help_you_identify_and_hire_the_Best_PHP_Developers_in_2022_for_your_project\" title=\"This article will list critical pointers that will help you identify and hire the Best PHP Developers in 2022 for your project.\">This article will list critical pointers that will help you identify and hire the Best PHP Developers in 2022 for your project.<\/a><ul class='ez-toc-list-level-3'><li class='ez-toc-heading-level-3'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-2\" href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/blog\/top-5-tips-for-hiring-best-php-developer.html\/#1_Avoid_asking_stereotype_questions\" title=\"1.
