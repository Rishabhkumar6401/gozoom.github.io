They can be confusing because they are used in various ways.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, when it comes to building a more engaging educational experience for students, augmented reality (AR) is one of the valuable eLearning solutions. By using 3D models and GIFs, AR can trigger images that navigate students directly to the detailed content. This provides an improved learning experience, making students more likely to retain the information.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Sensory_Development\"><\/span><strong>Sensory Development<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AR technology has also been used to help teachers create interactive and immersive environments for their classrooms, in which students can experience the Amazon as never before. Students can visit interactive exhibits that bring the Amazon to life with features such as 3D imagery, 360\u00b0 video, and sound. They can also experience an immersive environment in a 3D virtual world.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So far, AR has often been used as a teaching tool to help students learn about the natural environment and to develop an interest in it. Teachers have used AR to create interactive and immersive environments for their classrooms, in which students can experience the Amazon like never before.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Cost-Effective\"><\/span><b>Cost-Effective<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Models used in classes can be costly, limiting the amount of learning and exposure a student has to more elaborate content. On the flip side, AR is bridging this gap by allowing everyone to access content and 3D model without any hassle. With the recent updates to AR models and the sharing options, more students can now have access to learning content than ever before. No longer do they need to worry about who has access to which model, as they can now be shared with anyone that needs them. This helps to ensure that no student is left behind and any questions can be answered quickly and easily.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Fosters_Interactive_Environment\"><\/span><b>Fosters Interactive Environment<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An interactive learning environment benefits learners and teachers as it breaks the barriers, where learning becomes engaging and accessible. Traditional methods have certain hindrances, as knowledge is primarily limited to textual and theoretical approaches. But when it comes to AR, things are a bit different and exciting simultaneously.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AR technology provides an immersive, multisensory learning experience. It offers engaging, interactive ways of learning that reinforce traditional teaching methods and incorporate the latest technologies, sometimes helping teachers to \u201cmeet in the middle\u201d between the two.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Future_of_AR_in_learning_scenario\"><\/span><b>Future of AR in learning scenario<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Education is a necessary part of any society, and as technology advances, so too must our educational institutions. However, one recent trend has been AR disrupting the education industry. This technology allows students to learn in ways that are more advantageous to them, and as a result, education has been segregated based on the needs of the students.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The use of Augmented Reality (AR) in the classroom <\/span>Mobile App Solutions<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has been growing in popularity due to their ability to give friction-free access to various learning tools, thereby providing instantaneous information to anyone possessing the suitable means. By incorporating AR into the classroom, students can absorb information more quickly and retain it longer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today\u2019s technology is changing how we live, work, and learn.
