The healthcare industry is going through a digital uprising with the invasion of technology. Wearables empowered with artificial intelligence and big data are providing an added value to healthcare with a focus on accurate diagnosis, treatment, monitoring of vitals, and prevention. Wearable devices applied to healthcare offer multiple advantages to professionals as well as patients. In its most formative years, the growth of Wearables occurred mainly in the low-priced fitness tracker market.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"What_is_the_size_of_the_Wearables_Market\"><\/span>What is the size of the Wearables Market?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Wearable tech is an emerging technology, and there is a high level of potential for innovation in the area. With the phenomenal growth in the healthcare and fitness field and the increasing adoption of wearable devices by consumers, the worldwide market for Wearables is expected to nearly double in size by 2021. In view of this high level of innovation and growth in the wearable tech industry, there\u2019s no denying the future benefits that these devices will provide to both professionals and patients.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Types_of_Wearable_Devices\"><\/span>Types of Wearable Devices<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fitness Trackers<\/li>\n<li>Body Sensors\n<ul>\n<li>Wearable Patches<\/li>\n<li>Wrist Devices<\/li>\n<li>Heart Straps<\/li>\n<li>Headbands<\/li>\n<li>Posture Monitors<\/li>\n<li>Movement Sensors<\/li>\n<li>Wearable Defibrillator<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>Smart Clothing<\/li>\n<li>Smart Glasses<\/li>\n<li>Wearable Camera<\/li>\n<li>Others<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Who%E2%80%99s_buying_Wearables_and_why\"><\/span>Who\u2019s buying Wearables and why?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Wearables have appealed mostly to younger people.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>In 2015, <strong>24.0%<\/strong> of those ages 25 to 34 had a wearable device, while <strong>6.5%<\/strong> of those ages 55 to 64 had one.
