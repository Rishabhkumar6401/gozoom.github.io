It also predicts that by 2025, revenue generation via mobile apps will reach approximately 613 billion US dollars.<\/p>\n<p>The obstacles which stand between enterprises and remarkable apps are resources and skills. The most viable solution to these problems is outsourcing app development. But most enterprises tend to err while handing over project ideas to someone else which often leads to undesirable outcomes.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Here_are_six_common_mistakes_which_enterprises_make_while_outsourcing_mobile_app_development\"><\/span>Here are six common mistakes which enterprises make while outsourcing mobile app development.<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Rush_the_Planning_Phase\"><\/span>Rush the Planning Phase<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>App proliferation is a result of idea projection, and anyone with a great app idea will look forward to immediate implementation. This is where most enterprises make the first common mistakes; they rush their planning phase in exchange for implementation.<\/p>\n<p>A major reason to outsource mobile app development is to save resources and lack of planning can often lead to miscalculation of the same. While there are many things to plan and prepare, some key areas that need attention during this phase are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Preparation of checklist for technical and non-technical requirements<\/li>\n<li>Cost calculation with thorough analysis of requirements<\/li>\n<li>Verification of credibility of the company in question<\/li>\n<li>Cross-checking profiles of developers<\/li>\n<li>Assessment of your assigned team via proper communication<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Since money is at stake here, enterprises need to ensure that these key areas are well covered and entailed in their planning phase to avoid any pitfall in the future.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Poor_or_No_Risk_Mitigation\"><\/span>Poor or No Risk Mitigation<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>What if the project fails? What if the app doesn\u2019t perform as expected? There is a long list of what-ifs waiting for you before you finally decide to go ahead with your chosen company.<\/p>\n<p>Outsourcing involves risks, no matter how trivial, but to plunge blindly into it is another big common mistakes that some enterprises make, especially small and mid-sized businesses. Risk mitigation, therefore, becomes a crucial factor here.<\/p>\n<p>A wise thing to do is to set your parameters on how much you are willing to risk. For money, set a limit up to which the extent of loss is bearable. If the risk factor measures more to you, then moving on to another company is a wiser choice.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Overlooking_Hidden_Costs\"><\/span>Overlooking Hidden Costs<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>An often overlooked case, hidden costs can actually cost a lot for enterprises as there are companies which can lure you with low budgets but present you with added numbers at the billing time. If you\u2019re wondering how it is possible, then here&#8217;s how.<\/p>\n<p>Some companies hide costs involved in extra services including testing and post-development maintenance. Once you decide to go for those services, the numbers don\u2019t add up. That\u2019s why it is necessary to prepare a questionnaire and enlist services that you want from the company. This will help you to get a clear front on budget as well.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Insufficient_Clarifications_on_Scalability\"><\/span>Insufficient Clarifications on Scalability<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Hurray! Your app becomes a hit and huge success awaits you, but with success comes enhanced scope and scalability. Enterprises often are so focussed on the execution part that they often forget to negotiate on whether the app will be sturdy enough to handle increased traffic, continual data influx and further add-ons.<\/p>\n<p>Be clear on how your app is going to scale when the scope grows. How are they planning to handle their resources if you decide to work on multiple projects? What changes are going to be there regarding budget and resources? It is better to negotiate on these aspects beforehand rather than fumbling with the confusion later.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Inadequate_Knowledge_of_Testing_Methods\"><\/span>Inadequate Knowledge of Testing Methods<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Proper and meticulous testing not only ensures smooth functioning of a mobile app, but also goes a long way in preventing blunders. Whether they are bugs, technical errors or non-technical issues, thorough testing assures that the app is efficient enough to be launched and used.<\/p>\n<p>Most app development companies employ both manual and automated testing processes, but some intend to focus more on the former while others lay more emphasis on the latter. Also, the methods of testing have become quite extensive as mobile apps have given rise to several practical aspects too like testing app interface via actual end-users, responsiveness, accuracy etc.<\/p>\n<p>Regardless of the company\u2019s niche methods, it is important that enterprises know all about those. This is also required as there are companies which charge a tad bit more for automated processes as they are more precise and take less time.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Missing_Information_on_Post-development_Support\"><\/span>Missing Information on Post-development Support<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Developing an app is one thing but maintaining it is a whole different story. Post-development support services can range from upgrading apps to fixing bugs and assisting clients with performance issues. But, this is another area where enterprises are often misled.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/hire-mobile-app-developers.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hire a dedicated mobile app developer<\/a> who develops robust applications for you and promises maintenance, but they back out when it comes to assisting end clients as they hold themselves responsible for only upgrading the application.<\/p>\n<p>Stay clear on such premises and get a list of services which are included in post-development support otherwise it can put you into a false position in future leading to improper functioning of your app and client dissatisfaction.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Summing_Up\"><\/span>Summing Up<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>A neatly coded mobile app with a rich UI can lead to huge success, but while following those dreams, enterprises should not get lost and avoid the common mistakes often made during project outsourcing. So do remember:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Not to rush the planning phase<\/li>\n<li>To mitigate risks and discuss app scalability<\/li>\n<li>To watch out for hidden costs<\/li>\n<li>To know all about testing methods and post-development support services<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>These points will assist you in making the right decision. So what are you waiting for? Find your development partner to convert your brilliant ideas into remarkable mobile apps.<\/p>\n<div id=\"ez-toc-container\" class=\"ez-toc-v2_0_47_1 ez-toc-wrap-left counter-hierarchy ez-toc-counter ez-toc-transparent ez-toc-container-direction\">\n<div class=\"ez-toc-title-container\">\n<p class=\"ez-toc-title\">Table of Contents<\/p>\n<span class=\"ez-toc-title-toggle\"><\/span><\/div>\n<nav><ul class='ez-toc-list ez-toc-list-level-1 ' ><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/blog\/common-mistakes-enterprises-make-while-outsourcing.html\/#Here_are_six_common_mistakes_which_enterprises_make_while_outsourcing_mobile_app_development\" title=\"Here are six common mistakes which enterprises make while outsourcing mobile app development.\">Here are six common mistakes which enterprises make while outsourcing mobile app development.<\/a><ul class='ez-toc-list-level-3'><li class='ez-toc-heading-level-3'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-2\" href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/blog\/common-mistakes-enterprises-make-while-outsourcing.html\/#Rush_the_Planning_Phase\" title=\"Rush the Planning Phase\">Rush the Planning Phase<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-3'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-3\" href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/blog\/common-mistakes-enterprises-make-while-outsourcing.html\/#Poor_or_No_Risk_Mitigation\" title=\"Poor or No Risk Mitigation\">Poor or No Risk Mitigation<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-3'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-4\" href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/blog\/common-mistakes-enterprises-make-while-outsourcing.html\/#Overlooking_Hidden_Costs\" title=\"Overlooking Hidden Costs\">Overlooking Hidden Costs<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-3'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-5\" href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/blog\/common-mistakes-enterprises-make-while-outsourcing.html\/#Insufficient_Clarifications_on_Scalability\" title=\"Insufficient Clarifications on Scalability\">Insufficient Clarifications on Scalability<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-3'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-6\" href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/blog\/common-mistakes-enterprises-make-while-outsourcing.html\/#Inadequate_Knowledge_of_Testing_Methods\" title=\"Inadequate Knowledge of Testing Methods\">Inadequate Knowledge of Testing Methods<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-3'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-7\" href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/blog\/common-mistakes-enterprises-make-while-outsourcing.html\/#Missing_Information_on_Post-development_Support\" title=\"Missing Information on Post-development Support\">Missing Information on Post-development Support<\/a><\/li><\/ul><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-8\" href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/blog\/common-mistakes-enterprises-make-while-outsourcing.html\/#Summing_Up\" title=\"Summing Up\">Summing Up<\/a><\/li><\/ul><\/nav><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The mobile app development industry has come a long way and what started off as a technological trend has become today\u2019s core necessity, especially for enterprises that are looking forward to expand their customer base, enhance service accessibility and at the same time deliver enriching end-user experience.
