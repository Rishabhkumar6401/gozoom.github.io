Enhanced intelligence would probably be the number one element to define this market across different verticals. It is essential to partner with a leading wearable device app development company to gain an edge.<\/p>\n<p>Worldwide smart wearable device sales will double by 2022, becoming a $27 billion+ market with 233 million unit sales. That\u2019s the word according to industry analyst CCS Insight, who states that the growth is being powered by smartwatches, with fitness trackers on the slide in the next four years.<\/p>\n<p>CCS\u2019 report states that 85 million smartwatches will be sold in 2019, increasing to 137 million in 2022, but that sales of fitness trackers will drop by 43 million this year to 39 million within those four years. Of the 117 million smart wearable devices the analyst expects to ship this year, Apple will lead the way thanks to its popular smartwatch range. The latest Apple Watch &#8211; the fourth generation &#8211; launched last month and CCS claims that it is the main driver in smartwatch adoption and subsequent interaction.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Intelligent_Wearable_Assistants\"><\/span>Intelligent Wearable Assistants<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Considering the rise of intelligent wearables, AI empowers \u201cartificial coaches\u201d or assistants. This is particularly evident in the sports industry where advanced sensors and gadgets are embedded in smart apparel to provide users with real-time feedback on their metrics, actionable advice to improve their performance, and useful insights to decrease the risk of injuries.<\/p>\n<p>Today, several wearables rely on popular smart assistants, such as Alexa or Siri in Apple Watch. Now it is possible to insert Alexa directly into a wearable. Few products have tried to use this technology. On the other hand, some wearable manufacturers decided to equip their systems with custom, intelligent assistants that excel at a few specialized tasks instead of going all-purpose.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"AI_Analytics_in_Wearable_Healthcare\"><\/span>AI Analytics in Wearable Healthcare<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Wearables play a significant role in this outlook as the simplest, most convenient tools to collect health data, monitor and interact with users on the go. AI-powered platforms and devices can provide doctors access to vital health data from wearables. Further, this data is analyzed and used as an algorithm to prioritize patients requiring attention based on critical conditions.<\/p>\n<p>Wearables empowered with artificial intelligence and big data are providing an added value to healthcare with a focus on accurate diagnosis, treatment, monitoring of vitals and prevention. On the other hand, wearable technology can also sync with patient data analytics to build tracking devices. For instance, such tracking devices can be attached to the inhalers for the people who suffer from asthma to gauge health patterns of users and conditions in certain locations based on environmental conditions to forecast potential asthma attacks.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"AI_Tools_to_Improve_Security\"><\/span>AI Tools to Improve Security<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>AI is helping people lead healthy lifestyles and achieve goals related to staying fit. However, making changes that save people\u2019s lives is an entirely new level. AI is taking health and safety to an entirely new level. The system knows your directions, routes and automatically gives a turn signal, alerting the drivers around you.<\/p>\n<p>It utilizes training of guidance pace lights, which analyze your target training speeds and visually keeps you on pace in real-time. Moreover, it provides safety measures in danger zones like intersections where the majority of fatal accidents unfortunately occur.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Experience_with_Mixed_Reality\"><\/span>Experience with Mixed Reality<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>AI can handle <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/wearable-device-application-development.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">wearables application development<\/a> by managing the headset\u2019s performance to the requirements of users at that moment, instead. By communicating with the user and its environment, the intelligent machine can analyze and decipher the preferences, what type of information needs to be displayed and minimize the latencies experienced with mixed reality by dealing with different factors such as room layouts in real time.<\/p>\n<h4 style=\"font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 42px; color: #0a57f4;\">Conclusion<\/h4>\n<p>Combining AI along with the next generation of smart wearables has several advantages.
