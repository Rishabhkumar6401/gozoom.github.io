Even WordPress uses the language in its core interface helping developers enhance the existing platform. Compared to other languages, it is easy to learn and is supported excellently by the development community.<\/p>\n<p>On one side PHP helps developers create web applications quickly, but on the other side, there is no development environment associated with the language. Look at the development environment like Visual Studio from Microsoft. It comes with a plethora of features available from installation. It has features for coding, debugging, and deploying available to developers straight out of the box.<\/p>\n<p>When you look online, you will find that there are a number of packages and supporting tools for PHP easily available But, they tend to be scattered and are available in separate stages. This sometimes can cause issues for developers who want to enhance their virtual toolkit. As we discussed earlier, PHP is fast and it is the most used scripting language in practice.<\/p>\n<p>It has detailed documentation, a huge community, numerous ready-to-use scripts, and well-supported frameworks. On top of that, it is very easy to get started with this language. This is why it makes perfect sense to provide the huge community of PHP developers with an overview of useful <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hiddenbrains.com\/php-development.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PHP development<\/a> tools and resources that can make their development process easier and more effective.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Here_is_the_ultimate_list_of_the_best_PHP_development_tools_you_will_need\"><\/span>Here is the ultimate list of the best PHP development tools you will need.&nbsp;<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Following are some of the top 20 PHP development tools to develop a custom and robots web application development.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"color: #000; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 40px;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Selenium\"><\/span>Selenium<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>One of the most popular testing tools available today, Selenium Remote Control (RC) allows you to write automated Web application UI tests in any programming language against any HTTP website by putting to use any mainstream JavaScript-enabled browser.
