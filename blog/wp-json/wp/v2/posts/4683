With flat design, incorporation of this functionality have given aesthetic touch to the designing industry.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Flat scales well to smaller screens,&#8221; says Bradley Falk, CTO of New York City-based beauty startup Poshly, which revamped its website with flat-design principles. &#8220;This is because use of white space is important, but the buttons are uncluttered and big-easy to identify on mobile, faster to render and have smaller payloads. Flat really helps here, because I can spend less time designing pages specifically for a mobile device.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In addition to its optimization for multiple platforms, flat design&#8217;s clean, modern look is appealing to many businesses. But there&#8217;s more to it than that, suggests Brian Casel, a Connecticut-based designer and entrepreneur. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think that \u2018going flat&#8217; should be the sole reason for a redesign. Flat-design techniques should be used to support a larger set of goals. Those goals should be about meeting the needs and wants of your users,&#8221; he says.<\/p>\n<p>It is wise not to make objects animated while working with flat designs due to large images used in it. Generally, in\u00a0 minimalist design, designers intend to give more space for content to convey the message in direct way.<\/p>\n<p>Several other trends have begun to emerge out of flat design: \u201calmost flat design\u201d, \u201clong shadow design\u201d and a re-emphasis on the always popular minimalist design.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAlmost flat design\u201d is based on flat design but may include some degree of minimal effect, such as a simple shadow inside of an element or basic gradient.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cLong shadow design\u201d is used almost exclusively for icons and is exemplified by an image within an icon frame that has a tinted area that extends from the image; long shadows typically fall at 45-degree angles and include the same characteristics the rest of the flat design scheme.<\/p>\n<p>Flat design has also brought an emphasis back to minimalist design, even for designers not using flat-style techniques. As part of the overall trend, there has been a re-emphasis on whitespace; color, sharp shapes and lines; and a return to simple and basic typography.<\/p>\n<p>When choosing a user interface kit, don\u2019t get too hung up on color or color palette. Most kits include usable colors if you don\u2019t have a palette in mind, but allow you to change the overall color scheme with just a few clicks. Save time by creating usable swatches before opening the kit so that you don\u2019t have to type in manual color values for each change. Also consider using your color palette in the same way as the kit designer used the default swatches, mirroring color choices in tone, saturation and contrast for elements in the kit.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>To build an effect of three-dimensional visuals had always been favorite choice of design in digital UI.
